[0615]
Some weapons are especially[.]
effective against certain units.
These weapons will cause heavy
damage to those units. For
example, bows are particularly
effective against flying units.[.]
The weapon icons in the combat
information window will glow
when your unit is facing an[.]
enemy that is weak against
that weapon.
[0616]
Critical hits inflict three times[.]
the normal damage to enemies.[.]
Your chance of a critical strike
changes depending on your unit's
attributes and the weapon with
which you are attacking.
[0617]
Any attack from a weapon is a[.]
physical attack. Each unit's
DEF (defense) attribute[.]
shows how well he defends[.]
against physical attacks. The[.]
higher the number, the less[.]
damage he takes. Knights and
mercenaries have good defense.
[0618]
Any attack with magic is called[.]
a magical attack. Your unit's[.]
RES (resistance) attribute
shows how well he defends[.]
against them. The higher the
number, the less damage he
takes. Mages, monks, clerics
& shamans have high resistance.[.]
[0619]
Restore HP to your units by using[.]
vulneraries, elixirs, and staves.[.]
Vulneraries and elixirs heal
only the user, while staves heal
only the units on whom they're
used. Choose your healing[.]
items carefully in battle.
[061A]
There are five abnormal states
a unit can enter:[.]
1. Sleep
(Asleep and unable to move)[.]
2. Silence
(Unable to use magic or staves)[.]
3. Poison[.]
(Take continual damage)[.]
4. Berserk
(Attack enemies and allies alike)[.]
5. Petrify
(Turned to stone, cannot move)
These conditions will continue for
several turns. They can be
reversed with a Restore staff.
[061B]
Here is the information shown if
you choose the strategic
combat information window:

HP: Unit's remaining HP.
MT: Amount of damage the
equipped weapon inflicts.[.]
HIT: Chance an attack will land.
CRIT: Chance the weapon will
land a critical blow.[.]
[061C]
Here is the information shown if
you choose the detailed[.]
combat information window:

HP: Unit's remaining HP.
ATK: Amount of damage your
attack will inflict.
DEF: Amount of damage enemy[.]
attacks will be reduced by.[.]
HIT: Chance an attack will land.
CRIT: Chance the weapon will land[.]
a critical blow.
AS: The speed of each unit's
attack, which determines how
many attacks each unit makes.[.]
[061D]
Any unit can rescue a blue or[.]
green unit in an adjacent tile.[.]
However, your constitution must[.]
be higher than that of the unit[.]
you're trying to rescue.
The rescuing unit suffers a[.]
penalty in speed and skill,[.]
but the rescued unit is[.]
protected from attacks.[.]
If a unit is about to lose all
of its HP, use the rescue[.]
command to whisk it to safety.
[061E]
You can drop a rescued unit into
any adjacent tile. The dropped
unit will not be able to move[.]
until the next turn.
[061F]
You can purchase items at[.]
shops. You can also pick them[.]
up by visiting villagers and
opening chests. Enemies[.]
sometimes drop items when[.]
they are defeated.
[0620]
Choose an item from the item
list and press the A Button[.]
to use it. Items that cannot
be used by that unit will be
grayed out.[.]
[0621]
You can trade items with units
in adjacent tiles. Select Trade[.]
on the command menu, and then[.]
select the unit with whom you[.]
want to trade. Next, place the
cursor on the item you want to
take from the other unit's
inventory and press the A Button
to receive that item.[.]
[0622]
Items have a limited number of
uses. Each time you use an item[.]
its durability goes down. The[.]
number next to an item indicates
how many times it can be used.
When that number reaches 0, the[.]
item breaks and disappears.[.]
Be careful not to let items drop
to 0 in the heat of battle.[.]
[0623]
A supply convoy travels with
your main character. If you[.]
move to a space adjacent your[.]
supply convoy, you can trade
items with it. On the battle
preparation screen, you can[.]
also buy and sell items at the
supply convoy. The convoy can[.]
store up to 100 items for you.
[0624]
Move a unit onto an armory and
then choose Armory to buy[.]
weapons. You can also sell
items you've collected here.
[0625]
Move a unit onto a shop and[.]
then choose Shop to buy and[.]
sell items, magic tomes, and
staves.[.]
[0626]
Forests and mountains give
units additional cover. When
your units are in these tiles,
enemy hit percentages will be[.]
reduced. When entering attack[.]
range, try to stop in one of
these spaces.[.]
[0627]
Any unit that ends its turn[.]
on a fortress, castle gate,[.]
gate, or throne will regain[.]
some HP automatically at the
beginning of the next turn.[.]
[0628]
Move a unit to a house to visit[.]
the occupants of that house.
This is a good way of gaining[.]
useful information that might[.]
turn the battle in your favor.
Visit houses whenever you get[.]
the opportunity.
[0629]
Move a unit to a village to[.]
speak with its villagers.[.]
You can gain information,[.]
items, and even money from
villages, so visit them if
you have the opportunity.[.]
[062A]
Move units onto spaces with[.]
chests to open them. Chests[.]
are filled with all sorts of
useful items. However, you'll[.]
need a chest key or lockpicks[.]
to open the chest.
[062B]
If you see an old snag near[.]
a river, knock it over to[.]
form an impromptu bridge.[.]
[062C]
Attack cracked walls to[.]
destroy them and create[.]
new paths.
[062D]
Darkness and fog limit your[.]
field of vision, preventing[.]
you from seeing distant enemies.
Use thieves, torches, and[.]
Torch staves to increase your[.]
field of vision.
[062E]
These siege weapons[.]
fire missiles from long[.]
distances. Place an archer or[.]
sniper on them to use them.[.]
[062F]
On your quest, you will run[.]
across many characters who
might join your cause. Watch
story hints carefully to find[.]
who should talk to these
characters and convince them
to join you.
[0630]
Except in rare cases, if one of[.]
your units loses all of its HP,[.]
it will retreat from battle and be
unable to fight again. Be careful!
[0631]
Some units have special bonds[.]
between them. The longer they[.]
spend in adjoining spaces, the
stronger that bond will grow.[.]
Once this bond is strong enough,
the Support command will appear[.]
on the command menu.
Select it to make the characters
share a support conversation.[.]
[0632]
If supportive units are within
three spaces of each other they[.]
both gain special combat
bonuses. There are three levels[.]
of support. The higher the level,[.]
the better the bonuses received.
Support levels increase each
time units share a conversation.
[0633]
Green units are neutral. They[.]
may become allies if you speak
to them. If you move to a space[.]
adjacent to a green unit, the[.]
Talk command may appear.
Choose [OpenQuote]Talk[CloseQuote] to convince the[.]
unit to join you.[.]
[0634]
Some enemy units will join you
if you talk to them. Move a[.]
character you think might know
that enemy unit into a space
adjacent to it to see if they[.]
can talk.[.]
Be careful! Enemy units will
continue to attack until you
talk to them! Try not to take[.]
them out or be taken out before[.]
you have a chance to chat.
[0635]
If you defeat the enemy boss,[.]
you clear the map. There is no
need to defeat all enemy units.[.]
[0636]
Move the main character onto a
throne, castle gate, gate, or[.]
other such location and choose
Seize from the command menu[.]
to clear the map.[.]
[0637]
Clear the map by wiping out[.]
all enemy units.
[0638]
Hold out against the enemy for
a set number of turns to clear
the map.
[0639]
Choose Suspend on the command[.]
menu to save your game during[.]
a battle. The next time you[.]
play, choose Resume to continue[.]
playing where you left off.[.]
[063A]
Choose Save from the world map
to save your game data between
chapters.[.]
[063B]
Place the cursor on a space[.]
and press the A Button to[.]
move to that location.
[063C]
Some areas on the world map[.]
contain stores. You can see[.]
where stores are located by[.]
placing the cursor on a location
and viewing the shop icons that[.]
appear next to the place name.
You can enter any of these
stores if the main character
is at that location.
[063D]
Manage your units' items by[.]
placing the cursor on the[.]
main character and pressing[.]
the A Button.[.]
[063E]
Sometimes, creatures will appear
on an area you've already[.]
cleared. To drive off the[.]
monsters, move to that area[.]
and battle the fiends.
[063F]
Ready your units for battle[.]
before entering the battlefield.
Choose which units will fight,
and manage the weapons and
items they will use in the battle.
Press START to begin combat.
[0640]
Units gain EXP (experience
points) by fighting and by using
staves. They go up a level when[.]
they earn 100 EXP. As they go[.]
up in level, characters become
stronger, more skilled, etc.
The highest level is level 20.
[0641]
Most units can change classes[.]
once they reach level 10.[.]
Changing classes dramatically[.]
improves a unit's abilities.
If you're in a tough battle, be[.]
sure to change classes. When
changing classes, you will be able
to choose between 2 classes.
Look at the overall party[.]
makeup before deciding![.]
[0642]
If there's a command you're[.]
unfamiliar with, place the cursor[.]
over it and press the R Button.[.]
This will bring up a simple[.]
explanation of the command.[.]
[0643]
Visit an arena, and bet your
money and your life on single[.]
combat. Move a unit onto an[.]
arena and choose Arena from[.]
the command menu to enter.
If you win a battle, you'll[.]
win twice what you wagered.[.]
If you lose, that unit will[.]
be gone for good.[.]
[0644]
You can escape from battles[.]
in towers, in ruins, or with
monsters. On the command menu,
select Retreat to withdraw
from combat in any of these[.]
locations.

[07D5]
Eirika, Restoration Queen[.]
[07D6]
Eirika returned to Renais and began the[.]
reconstruction effort with her brother,[.]
Ephraim. Seeing peace return to the lives[.]
of her people filled her with happiness.
Her smile became a symbol of her people's joy.
[07D7]
Seth, the Silver Knight[.]
[07D8]
Seth returned to Renais with Ephraim and his
fellow knights. His dedicated service made him
the most trusted of the new king and queen's
guardsmen, as well as the most famous of
knights in all of Renais.[.]
[07D9]
Silent Gilliam
[07DA]
Gilliam returned to his home of Frelia, where[.]
he continued to serve the crown as a faithful[.]
knight. His imposing countenance was said to
strike fear in the hearts of even the most
arrogant and brash of Frelia's new recruits.
[07DB]
Franz the Faithful
[07DC]
He continued to serve Renais with the same
devotion that he had during the War of the
Stones. His generous nature and easy smile
made him a favorite among the people.[.]
[07DD]
Moulder, Wise Counselor[.]
[07DE]
After the War of the Stones, Moulder
continued to serve the royal family of
Frelia. His wisdom served to guide [.]
King Innes as it had served King Hayden[.]
before him.[.]
[07DF]
Vanessa, Dutiful Rider
[07E0]
She remained on active duty as an airborne
knight in Frelia's army. Her beauty and[.]
determination became the standard to which
her fellow knights aspired.[.]
[07E1]
Ross, His Father's Son
[07E2]
He returned to Ide, village of his youth,[.]
and helped rebuild it after the bandit
attack that brought it to ruin. Years later,
he set out on his own to perfect his fighting[.]
skill and hone both body and spirit.
[07E3]
Neimi, the Tearful Archer[.]
[07E4]
She returned to her village and passed
her days in peace and quiet. Years later,[.]
she traveled to the capital of Renais as
an archery instructor for their military.[.]
She never could resist a good cry.
[07E5]
Colm, Good-Natured Thief
[07E6]
He politely refused an invitation to
become a spy for Renais, returning instead
to his hometown. He spent the rest of his[.]
days as a chivalrous rogue helping those
in need from the shadows.[.]
[07E7]
Garcia, the Warrior Reborn
[07E8]
He returned to Ide to help with its[.]
reconstruction after the bandit attack.[.]
Afterward, he reenlisted in the army, serving[.]
Renais as a troop leader. His strength,[.]
valor, and experience inspired many.
[07E9]
Innes, King and Strategician
[07EA]
As time went on, he succeeded his father,[.]
Hayden, as king of Frelia. His resourcefulness
and tactical prowess helped him build a court[.]
of loyal vassals that served to lead the
country to greater prosperity.
[07EB]
Lute, Prodigy[.]
[07EC]
After the War of the Stones, Lute returned to 
Renais to continue her arcane studies. She [.]
spent far less time locked in her library,
preferring now to explore the outside world.
She grew into a great and well-traveled sage.[.]
[07ED]
Natasha, Sacred Healer
[07EE]
Once the war was over, Natasha returned to
Grado to help rebuild the empire. She dedicated[.]
herself to easing the grief of those families[.]
that lost soldiers during the war.
[07EF]
Cormag, Aloof Lanceman
[07F0]
Cormag returned to Grado to assist in the[.]
reconstruction of his country. Shortly
after, he left to wander on his own. When[.]
he reappeared, he rejoined the army not as
a knight but as a common soldier.[.]
[07F1]
Ephraim, Restoration King[.]
[07F2]
Busy days awaited him upon his return to
Renais. He oversaw the rebuilding not only
of his own country but also of the entire[.]
continent of Magvel. His work was difficult,
but his success made him a legend.
[07F3]
Forde, the Wild Knight
[07F4]
Upon Forde's return to Renais, his secret[.]
hobby of painting was discovered. He was
commissioned as a court artist. His work
grew popular, and his days became so busy[.]
that he often regretted his career change.
[07F5]
Kyle, Ardent Knight[.]
[07F6]
His service to the royal family of Renais[.]
continued without change. He became a[.]
battalion commander and gained much trust[.]
and responsibility for training new recruits.[.]
[07F7]
Amelia, Rose of the War[.]
[07F8]
Following the war, she returned to Grado
to assist in her country's reconstruction.
She surrounded herself with new friends and[.]
used the strength she found on the battlefield
to live her life in happiness.
[07F9]
Artur, Saint of Light[.]
[07FA]
Artur moved to Renais to help rebuild the[.]
shattered country. He worked without rest to
ease the pain and grief of those who suffered[.]
during the war. His self-sacrifice made him[.]
into a folk hero among the peasantry.[.]
[07FB]
Gerik, the Desert Tiger[.]
[07FC]
Gerik continued as a mercenary. Over the
years, his reputation grew so great that he[.]
had more job offers than he could handle. One[.]
day, without warning, he left, never to return.[.]
[07FD]
Tethys, Beloved Dancer
[07FE]
She danced from city to city, and the[.]
entire continent became her stage.
Her fame grew and grew, and large crowds
gathered wherever she performed.
[07FF]
Marisa, the Crimson Flash[.]
[0800]
Marisa became battalion leader for an[.]
elite mercenary force. Many men sought
to challenge her to a duel, and none
of them stood up to her blade.
[0801]
Saleh, the Well of Wisdom[.]
[0802]
Saleh returned to Caer Pelyn, where he
remained a faithful servant of the Manakete.
His days were not spent in isolation, though.[.]
Many of the friends he met during the War of
the Stones came to visit his village.[.]
[0803]
Ewan, Enthusiastic Student
[0804]
Ewan continued his studies, modeling
his life after the teachings of Saleh.
Eventually, his education branched off into[.]
different paths. His insatiable curiosity[.]
led him on a trip to explore the world.[.]
[0805]
L'Arachel, Queen of Light[.]
[0806]
She succeeded her uncle as ruler of the[.]
Rausten Theocracy several years after[.]
the war ended. She never lost her...unique
perspective on life. She spent much of her
rule visiting the neighboring countries.
[0807]
Dozla of the Steady Axe[.]
[0808]
As L'Arachel rose to become queen, he[.]
remained by her side. Watching L'Arachel
grow to become the queen she was destined to
be was Dozla's greatest joy in life.
[0809]
Rennac, Rich [OpenQuote]Merchant[CloseQuote][.]
[080A]
L'Arachel summoned Rennac back to Rausten,
and he was forced to return. He was never[.]
able to escape his service to the self-[.]
centered princess who became queen.[.]
Admittedly, he didn't try very hard.
[080B]
Duessel, Obsidian General[.]
[080C]
Following the war, Duessel returned to Grado,[.]
where he was instrumental in its rebuilding.
He spent his remaining years watching over
Grado and sharing his wisdom with other[.]
nations as an expert combat instructor.[.]
[080D]
Myrrh, the Great Dragon[.]
[080E]
After bidding her farewells to Ephraim,[.]
she returned to Darkling Woods. She lived[.]
a long and full life, served by the people
of Caer Pelyn and comforted by the memories[.]
of her dear friends.
[080F]
Knoll, Watcher of Darkness
[0810]
Knoll returned to Grado, where he dedicated[.]
himself to rebuilding it and fulfilling[.]
Lyon's vision. When the country was restored
to its former glory, he disappeared without[.]
a trace, never to be seen again.
[0811]
Joshua, the Tempest King
[0812]
Joshua returned to Jehanna and ruled over[.]
it as king. His skills as a leader had
grown great, and Jehanna flourished as
never before. He never outgrew his love[.]
of travel and games of chance.
[0813]
Graceful Syrene[.]
[0814]
Syrene continued as commander of Frelia's[.]
pegasus knights. Her grace and beauty in
flight were the subject of many songs[.]
and paintings, and her popularity soared.[.]
[0815]
Tana, Winged Queen
[0816]
Tana lived happily in the prosperous post-
war Frelia. She flew to Renais often to[.]
visit her dear friend Eirika.[.]
[0817]
Busy days awaited Eirika and Ephraim as they
struggled to rebuild Renais. Their work gave
new hope to those ravaged by the war, and[.]
with Eirika's constant help, Ephraim grew to
be a trusted and honorable king.
[0818]
Upon their return to Renais, Eirika and Seth
were wed, with the blessings of Ephraim and all[.]
of the Knights of Renais. The tale of the love
that grew between a princess and her loyal
knight became a beloved romance in Renais.
[0819]
After the war, Eirika and Saleh returned to their[.]
respective homes. Eirika visited Caer Pelyn[.]
when she could. Eventually, she left Renais in
the care of her brother and wed Saleh. Their
daughter resembles the legendary Nada Kuya.[.]
[081A]
Following the war, Tana and Eirika remained[.]
the best of friends. They visited one another[.]
when time permitted, and as they grew older,
their children shared a bond of friendship
as close as Eirika and Tana themselves did.[.]
[081B]
After the war, Eirika and Forde returned to[.]
Renais. Eirika spent her days toiling in
the reconstruction of Renais, and he was her
faithful supporter. His portrait of Eirika
captured the smile he had thought lost forever.[.]
[081C]
After the war, Ephraim returned to Renais and[.]
Myrrh to Darkling Woods. They both turned their[.]
attention to their respective duties but never
forgot one another. Though Myrrh never again
left Darkling Woods, Ephraim often visited her.[.]
[081D]
Ephraim and L'Arachel each returned home
after the war, but L'Arachel visited Renais[.]
often. Over time, the two were wed. Their[.]
marriage threw Rausten into turmoil, but
L'Arachel's self-centeredness carried the day.
[081E]
Once Renais was stable again, Ephraim and[.]
Tana were wed. Innes protested vocally, but[.]
when he saw how happy Tana was, he gave the[.]
marriage his blessings. Renais and Frelia[.]
are now bound by blood as well as friendship.[.]
[081F]
Natasha returned to Renais with Seth, where[.]
the two were wed. The reconstruction of Renais
kept them busy, but when all the work was[.]
done, they settled down to live their days
in peace and happiness.[.]
[0820]
Franz brought Amelia home with him to Renais.[.]
Amelia spent a short time in Renais's army,[.]
but once she and Franz were married, she
retired her commission. The two had a daughter
who grew to be a great knight herself.
[0821]
Gilliam and Syrene returned to Frelia, where they[.]
were married. All agreed they were a perfect
match, and their union was blessed by the[.]
crown and the order of knights. The two[.]
continued their unwavering service together.
[0822]
At Innes's request, Vanessa moved into
Castle Frelia where she continued her duties
as a knight of the realm. Thereafter, they
had a child and lived happily with the
blessing of all around them.
[0823]
Forde's love for Vanessa grew after the war,
and although she loved him as well, she[.]
placed her duty to Frelia first. Undeterred,
Forde moved to Frelia himself. Over time,[.]
the two were wed.[.]
[0824]
Father and son returned to Ide, where they
toiled together to rebuild their village.[.]
Ross grew to become a greater warrior than
even his father. When he himself had a son,[.]
that child continued his family's legacy.[.]
[0825]
The childhood friends became lovers first,
then husband and wife. Worried for Neimi's
well-being, Colm gave up his adventurer's ways.[.]
Neimi passed on her grandfather's skill in
archery to her own son and daughter.
[0826]
Artur and Lute were married upon their return.
Artur handled the housework, but otherwise,[.]
their lives were unchanged. When they had a[.]
son, Lute's interests shifted from studying[.]
Artur to studying her son's baffling habits.
[0827]
After the war, Kyle and Lute were married in
Renais. Kyle's friends were disturbed by his
choice of brides, but they could not deny[.]
his happiness. Before long, they had a son,[.]
and Kyle dedicated himself to his upbringing.[.]
[0828]
When Joshua returned to Jehanna, he took
Natasha as his bride and claimed the throne[.]
as its rightful heir. Natasha was the perfect[.]
companion, and together, they carried the[.]
mighty desert nation to great glory.
[0829]
Sometimes, the greatest friends also differ[.]
greatly in personality. When Kyle and Forde[.]
returned home, they were celebrated in song[.]
and story. They lived their days in happiness,
as dearest friends and toughest rivals.[.]
[082A]
Cormag returned to Grado to assist in the[.]
reconstruction of his country. Shortly
after, he left to wander on his own. Tana[.]
spent years looking for him. In time, she[.]
found him and knighted him in Frelia's service.[.]
[082B]
Stories tell of the sparks that flew between
L'Arachel and Innes when they first met. As[.]
the love between them flourished, so too did
the bond that united their two nations.[.]
[082C]
Gerik and Tethys remained bound to no nation
and beholden to no authority. They bought[.]
themselves a leisurely retirement. Gerik
taught fencing to city youths, and Tethys[.]
found many stages on which to dance.
[082D]
Gerik remained a mercenary, and Marisa
became his company's fencing instructor.
Gerik returned the affection she gave[.]
him, although he was troubled to learn she
was clumsy at everything but fighting.
[082E]
Myrrh returned to Darkling Woods, but at
Saleh's request, she eventually moved to Caer[.]
Pelyn. In time, the townsfolk learned to
treat her not as the Great Dragon but[.]
rather as a normal girl, and she was happy.[.]
[082F]
Master and student returned to Caer Pelyn to
study in peace. Ewan worked hard, and in time,
his power grew to rival Saleh's. As equals,[.]
the two continued their studies together and
expanded their knowledge ever more.[.]
[0830]
Joshua returned to Jehanna with Marisa, where[.]
she pledged service to the crown and became[.]
the top swordfighter in the land. Joshua still
loved games of chance, but when it came to
Marisa, she was ever the winner.
[0831]
L'Arachel was, in time, made queen of Rausten,
with Dozla at her side, as always. Later, Dozla[.]
wept like a baby when L'Arachel was wed. His
emotional outburst is remembered as much as,
if not more than, the ceremony itself.
[0832]
Amelia traveled to Ross's hometown, where she[.]
decided to remain. Over time, the two fell in[.]
love and were wed. Years later they had a son[.]
who grew into a warrior. As he grew in skill
and strength, he surpassed even his father.[.]
[0833]
After the war, Ewan and Amelia set out, as
promised, on a trip around the world. Their[.]
deeds along the way made small legends in the[.]
regions they visited. In time, Amelia gave
birth to a daughter, and they settled down.[.]
[0834]
After the war, Joshua challenged Gerik to a[.]
duel in hopes of pressing him to move to
Jehanna. The match ended in a tie, but Gerik
was impressed by Joshua's swagger. From that
day forward, Gerik never left Joshua's side.
[0835]
Sisters Syrene and Vanessa returned to Frelia[.]
after the war for a long-overdue talk. They[.]
talked of love and war, of friends now gone.
Together, they renewed their bond as siblings[.]
and vowed never to let that bond fail.
[0836]
After the reconstruction of Renais, Innes[.]
challenged Ephraim to a duel. The match[.]
ended in a tie. After the fight, Eirika[.]
acknowledged her love for Innes, and the
two were wed with Ephraim's blessings.
[0837]
After the war, Kyle visited Frelia, where[.]
he was greeted with a warm reception by[.]
Syrene. After the two retired, they were
wed. They raised a daughter whose skill[.]
in martial arts and etiquette excelled.[.]
[0838]
Upon their return to Grado, Duessel reunited
Amelia with her mother. The two wept with[.]
joy, giving thanks to Duessel. Afterward, Amelia
became the most trusted companion of the
man once known as Obsidian.[.]

The continent of Magvel.[A]
For some 800 years, a quiet peace reigned in [.]
the absence of the terrible darkness.[.][A]
The Sacred Stones have been passed from 
generation to generation.[.][A]
Nations have been built around their power [.]
and their legacy.[.][A][Clear]
[LoadOverworldFaces]The kingdom of Renais, ruled by Fado, 
the peerless Warrior King.[A][Clear]
[LoadOverworldFaces]The kingdom of Frelia, ruled by Hayden, 
the venerable Sage King.[A][Clear]
[LoadOverworldFaces]The kingdom of Jehanna, ruled by Ismaire, 
Queen of the White Dunes.[.][A][Clear]
[LoadOverworldFaces]The theocracy of Rausten, ruled by Mansel, [.]
the Divine Emperor.[.][A][Clear]
[LoadOverworldFaces]The Grado Empire, ruled by Vigarde, 
the stalwart Silent Emperor.[A][Clear]
[LoadOverworldFaces]These five countries house the power of 
the Sacred Stones.[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]They are joined by the emerging mercantile [.]
republic of Carcino.[A][Clear]
[LoadOverworldFaces]In these times of peace, tales of past
conflict have drifted into legend,[A]
and memories of the ancient dark arts[.]
have all but evaporated.[A][Clear]
[LoadOverworldFaces]It is now the year 803...[.][A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]In an instant, the whole of Magvel is 
threatened by an unexpected atrocity.[.][A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]The Grado Empire, the largest of the [.]
Sacred Stone nations,[.][A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]has invaded the kingdom of Renais under 
orders from Emperor Vigarde.[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]A longtime ally of Grado, Renais is caught
off guard, unable to mount any resistance.[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Grado's forces move quickly, seizing one
territory after another.[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Compounding King Fado's worries, his son,[.]
Prince Ephraim, has gone missing.[.][A][Clear]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Grado's momentum carries its armies to the [.]
gates of Castle Renais itself.[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Renais will fall...[.]
It is inevitable.[.][A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]
[08DC]
Eirika and her companions have liberated [.]
the border castle.[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Alongside Princess Tana of Frelia, they ride [.]
to the Frelian capital.[.][A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]
[08DD]
The world map shows the continent in [.]
its entirety.[.][A][Clear]
Castles, towns, and other map points
are added to the map as you play.[.][A][Clear]
Press the A Button when not on a map [.]
point to open the [ToggleRed]map menu[ToggleRed].[.][A]
This is where you can [ToggleRed]save[ToggleRed].[.]
When you want to stop playing, use this 
option to save your progress.[.][A][Clear]
Now then, move on to your next
destination.[A]
The marker with the [ToggleRed]red flag[ToggleRed] in the center
of the map is your destination.[.][A]
Move the triangle cursor onto the red flag [.]
and press the A Button.[.][A]
[08DE]
King Hayden apologizes for being unable to [.]
spare soldiers.[.][A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]However, he does provide Eirika with a small [.]
but trusted party of vassals.[.][A][Clear]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Eirika is grateful for the king's aid.[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Chasing rumors of her brother, she sets out 
for Grado.[A][Clear]
[LoadOverworldFaces]The group's first stop is the remote village [.]
of Ide, which was, until very recently, [A]
a part of Renais.[.][A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Here, Eirika sees the devastation of Renais 
with her own eyes.[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]
[08DF]
Once cleared, battle sites become [ToggleRed]bases[.][ToggleRed]. 
You can [ToggleRed]manage items[ToggleRed] on any base.[.][A][Clear]
To manage items, place the cursor on your 
character icon.[.][A]
Then, press the A Button to bring up the
[ToggleRed]Manage Items[ToggleRed] command.[.][A]
Choose Manage Items to trade possessions
with your supply convoy or with other units.[A][Clear]
Some map areas have [ToggleRed]shops[.][ToggleRed]
and [ToggleRed]armories[ToggleRed].[.][A]
To see if a base has a shop or an[.]
armory, move the cursor to that base.[.][A]
For example, in Ide, where Eirika is
now, there is an [.][ToggleRed]armory[ToggleRed].[.][A]
Check the corner of the screen for the
[ToggleRed]base name[.][ToggleRed] and any [.][ToggleRed]shop icons[ToggleRed].[.][A]
[08E0]
Eirika and company pursue the thief who 
stole her bracelet.[.][A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Their chase leads them into the mountains,
where Bazba's Bandits pillage at will.[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Eirika cannot ignore her countrymen's pleas 
for help.[.][A]
She leads her group in search of the [.]
bandits' stronghold.[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]
[08E1]
With her bracelet recovered, Eirika sets
out with renewed determination.[.][A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Passing through the ancient forest Za'ha [.]
brings them close to Grado's border.[A]
As they near the town of Serafew, Eirika's
fears are assuaged by the lack of troops.[.][A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]But never-before-seen terrors crawl in the [.]
shadows of the trees.[.][A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]
[08E2]
An ominous wave of dark creatures washes [.]
over the continent...[.][A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Eirika's journey to find her brother, Ephraim, [.]
grows ever more perilous.[.][A]
Still, she presses on despite the danger. 
Her will is strong.[.][A][Clear]
[LoadOverworldFaces]The town of Serafew, located on the border [.]
of Renais and Grado.[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]The people of both countries have long used 
the town as a meeting place.[A]
It stands as testimony to the friendship the [.]
two nations have shared these many years.[.][A]
Now, however, Serafew is teeming with 
Grado troops.[.][A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]
[08E3]
Eirika suppresses her feelings of unease [.]
and continues to search for her brother.[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Passing through Serafew, the group crosses [.]
into the Grado Empire.[A][Clear]
From here forward, there is no doubt that[.]
they are walking through hostile territory.[.][A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]In hopes of avoiding unnecessary trouble,[.][A]
Eirika and company head for a sparsely
populated region of Grado.[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]However, it is too late. Their movements are [.]
already being tracked.[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]
[08E4]
Rumors say that Ephraim has been defeated 
and taken prisoner.[.][A]
Now Eirika must find a way to rescue her [.]
brother from beneath enemy eyes.[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Eirika's company rushes toward Castle 
Renvall, where Ephraim is being held.[.][A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Surrounded by lakes, Renvall is a natural[.]
fortress, all but unassailable.[.][A]

A lone bridge, held by the enemy, is its
only entrance.[A][Clear]
Eirika has only one choice.[.][A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Eirika decides to confront Grado's soldiers 
head on...[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]
[08E5]
The [ToggleRed]Tower of Valni[ToggleRed] has appeared to the
east of Castle Frelia on the world map.[.][A]
Once held by Grado's troops, it has become
home to a host of [ToggleRed]dark creatures[ToggleRed].[.][A]
Battling these monstrosities is a good [.]
way for units to gain strength.[.][A]
Try using the tower as a training area [.]
to gain extra experience.[.][A][Clear]
Be aware: you cannot save your battle 
preparations for tower skirmishes.[A]
Once you clear a tower map, you'll have 
access to the next floor.[.][A]
Each floor is more difficult than the last, 
so come prepared![.][A][Clear]
Dark creatures also may appear on other 
bases on the world map.[.][A]
To engage these demons in combat,[.][A]
simply place the cursor on their location 
and press the A Button.[.][A][Clear]
If the battle goes poorly and you're in 
danger of losing units,[.][A]
use the [ToggleRed]retreat[.][ToggleRed] command on the map 
menu to withdraw your troops.[.][A]
[08E6]
Eirika chooses to travel by sea to the [.]
theocracy of Rausten.[.][A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Her search for a ship leads her to Port Kiris 
in Carcino.[.][A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Carcino is a young nation ruled by a council
of merchants, and it is an ally of Frelia.[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Carcino council leader Klimt, a staunch 
opponent of Grado's imperialistic actions,[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]has pledged Carcino's support to Frelia in [.]
this conflict.[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Prince Innes also intends to pass through 
Carcino on his way to Jehanna.[A]

Eirika believes there is nothing to fear [.]
in Carcino, but she is wrong.[.][A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]
[08E7]
Carcino has betrayed Frelia and joined forces 
with Grado.[.][A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Carcino's troops stop Prince Innes, blocking
his way to Jehanna.[.][A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]With soldiers occupying the road forward and [.]
back, he is trapped in a hopeless situation.[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Eirika rushes to the prince's aid.[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]
[08E8]
The Caer Pelyn Range...[.][A]

According to Ewan, a little-known passage 
to Jehanna lies there,[A]

hidden within its cracked red bedrock and 
knife-edged peaks.[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]To avoid Carcino and combat, Eirika's[.]
troops take the mountain path.[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]They begin climbing higher and higher toward [.]
Caer Pelyn.[.][A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Unbeknownst to the group, hordes of dark [.]
creatures now roam the peaks.[.][A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]
[08E9]
Jehanna, home of dancing white sands.[.][A]
This largely barren desert nation is infamous 
for its mercenary forces.[.][A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]In accordance with her husband's dying wish, [.]
the beautiful Ismaire rules Jehanna.[A]

The Queen of the White Dunes governs [.]
Jehanna with grace and honor.[.][A]

When he was young, her son left Jehanna.
His whereabouts remain unknown.[.][A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]After passing through Caer Pelyn, Eirika [.]
arrives in Jehanna.[.][A]

There, she finds the nation embroiled in [.]
combat with Grado's forces.[.][A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]
[08EA]
Thanks to the arrival of reinforcements[.]
from Princess L'Arachel of Rausten,[.][A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Eirika and her allies successfully repel the [.]
Grado invaders.[.][A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Still, Jehanna Hall remains under siege, on 
the edge of ruin.[.][A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]En route, Eirika learns that the hall has 
indeed been captured by Grado.[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]To rescue Queen Ismaire and recover 
Jehanna's Sacred Stone,[.][A]

Eirika leads an assault on the royal hall.[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]
[08EB]
Jehanna Hall has capitulated to Grado's 
forces and the Knights of Rausten,[A]

who rode to Jehanna's aid, have been routed 
by General Valter.[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]On their own again, Eirika and company flee 
into the desert.[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Without mercy, Generals Valter and Caellach 
come hunting.[.][A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Eirika is soon brought to ground.[.]
Enemy forces close in on all sides.[.][A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]
[08EC]
The capital of Renais.[A]

After the twins' absence, seeing their home[.]
ruined by war brings them terrible grief.[.][A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Orson, a former Knight of Renais, had been [.]
assigned to guard Castle Renais.[A]
However, he switched allegiances, betraying 
his oaths of loyalty to his homeland.[.][A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Eirika marks her homecoming by vowing to see [.]
Renais healed.[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]
[08ED]
The Sacred Stones that defeated the Demon[.]
King radiate a constant and dazzling light.[.][A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]The Sacred Stones are the only power against
the dark, the last hope of humanity. [.][A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]It is only natural that evil would seek[.]
to destroy the Sacred Stones...[.][A]

There can be no other force behind this[.]
attempt to gain the stones.[.][A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]A childhood friend appears before Eirika.[.][A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]
[08EE]
The group sets off in search of Grado's 
elusive Imperial Prince Lyon.[.][A]

Innes has ordered Frelian troops to aid in [.]
the hunt.[.][A]
The troops return with news that Lyon has 
moved north.[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]The group's search for Lyon leads them to 
Mt. Neleras, in the heart of Darkling Woods.[A]

The scorching heat and sulphur stench render [.]
the area unfit for human habitation...[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Endless numbers of gorgon eggs stud the 
forbidding landscape. [A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]
[08EF]
The Sacred Stone of Renais has been 
broken.[.][A]
Constant strife with dark creatures has[.]
made the group's progress near impossible.[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Princess L'Arachel of Rausten suggests they[.]
pay a visit to Rausten Court.[.][A]

It is here that the final Sacred Stone
is sealed away.[.][A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]L'Arachel rides cheerfully toward her homeland [.]
with the company in tow.[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]
[08F0]
According to legend, the Sacred Stones [.]
have sealed evil away from the world.[.][A]
Four of the five stones have been destroyed,
leaving only the last stone intact.[.][A]

The last stone must be protected to stave[.]
off the Demon King's restoration.[.][A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Eirika and company challenge the demons of [.]
Darkling Woods.[.][A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]According to legend,[A]

the original possessors of the Sacred Stones
defeated the Demon King in Darkling Woods.[A]

His foul blood seeped into the land,
corrupting every seed and every root.[.][A]

The once-pristine forest was transformed by[.]
the flood of disease and venom.[.][A]

Legend says the Demon King's corpse lies [.]
there still, not dead but dreaming.[.][A]

Dreaming of when the last stone is crushed,[.][A]
and he will rise from his bed of rocks and [.]
worms and return to the surface.[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Within Darkling Woods, hideous fiends roam
in increasing numbers, as if responding[.][A]
to some unheard call...[.][A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]
[08F1]
Ephraim begins his march south toward[.]
Grado from Castle Frelia.[.][A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Upon conquering Renais, the Grado Empire
has set its sights on Frelia.[.][A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]However, Innes and his troop meet the 
invaders at the waters' edge.[.][A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Against all odds, Innes halts the invasion, 
keeping Frelia's border intact.[.][A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Ephraim coordinates Frelia's troops in an[.]
effort to advance the front lines.[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Unbeknownst to Ephraim, Grado forces are [.]
waiting for them at Fort Rigwald.[.][A]

They've fortified their positions and plan
to wait out Frelia's siege.[.][A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Undaunted, Ephraim remains determined 
to root out Grado.[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]
[08F2]
A former lance instructor to Ephraim,[.][A]
Grado's General Duessel often came to Renais [.]
as an emissary of his empire.[.][A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Despite their stations, the two men share 
similar dispositions and a warm relationship.[.][A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Why has Grado started this war?[.][A]
What is the miasma of evil emanating [.]
from the country?[.][A]

Ephraim believes that Duessel can answer
these questions.[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]It is this belief that propels Ephraim
forward into Grado territory.[.][A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]
[08F3]
General Duessel tells them of the enigmatic 
Dark Stone.[.][A]

The product of Grado's research into [.]
the dark arts, [.][A]

the Dark Stone possesses power far beyond 
that of the Sacred Stones.[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]According to the rumors swirling about, [A]

Vigarde's descent into madness coincides [.]
with the creation of the Dark Stone.[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Ephraim must confirm the existence of[.]
the Dark Stone. [A]
He decides to travel to Grado by sea.[.][A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Midway through their passage, however,
an eerie fog begins to form...[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]
[08F4]
Ephraim leads the group to Za'albul Marsh in [.]
search of the missing Myrrh.[A]

They learn from soldiers and villagers that 
Myrrh had been captured by General Selena, [.][A]

one of Grado's commanders.
She was last seen heading east.[.][A]

To regain their companion, the group will 
now be forced to fight.[.][A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Ephraim steels his heart to the reality[.]
that he must face Selena.[.][A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]
[08F5]
Myrrh returns safely to Ephraim's side.[.][A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]A noble warrior to the end, Selena fought[.]
with great honor, [A]

never once using Myrrh as a hostage.[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Ephraim renews his vow to pierce the veil 
of mystery surrounding the Grado Empire.[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Selena is added to the list of innocents who [.]
Grado must account for.[.][A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]The center of the Grado Empire. Emperor[.]
Vigarde should have been here, but...[.][A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]
[08F6]
Ephraim's sister is in danger.[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Grado's General Caellach has attacked 
Jehanna Hall, forcing its surrender.[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Though Eirika and her troop have left the 
Hall, Grado's forces pursue them relentlessly.[A]

Trapped in the burning desert, enemy forces[.]
close in on them from all sides. [.][A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]With no time to wait for Frelia's troops, 
Ephraim leaves for Jehanna immediately.[.][A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]He must go to his sister's aid.[.][A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]
[08F7]
The capital of Renais.[A]

After the twins' absence, seeing their home[.]

Innes has ordered Frelian troops to aid in [.]
the hunt.[.][A]
The troops return with news that Lyon has 
moved north.[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]The group's search for Lyon leads them to[.]
Mt. Neleras, deep within Darkling Woods.[A]

The scorching heat and sulphur stench render [.]
the area unfit for human habitation...[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Endless numbers of gorgon eggs stud the 
forbidding landscape. [A]

The Sacred Stone of Renais has been 
broken.[.][A]
Constant strife with dark creatures has[.]
made the group's progress near impossible.[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Princess L'Arachel of Rausten suggests they[.]
pay a visit to Rausten Court.[.][A]

It is here that the final Sacred Stone
is sealed away.[.][A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]L'Arachel rides cheerfully toward her homeland [.]
with the company in tow.[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]
[08FB]
According to legend, the Sacred Stones [.]
have sealed evil away from the world.[.][A]
Four of the five stones have been destroyed,
leaving only the last stone intact.[.][A]

The last stone must be protected to stave[.]
off the Demon King's restoration.[.][A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Ephraim and company challenge the demons of 
Darkling Woods.[.][A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]According to legend,[A]

the original possessors of the Sacred Stones
defeated the Demon King in Darkling Woods.[A]

His foul blood seeped into the land,
corrupting every seed and every root.[.][A]

The once-pristine forest was transformed by[.]
the flood of disease and venom.[.][A]

Legend says the Demon King's corpse lies [.]
there still, not dead but dreaming.[.][A]

Dreaming of when the last stone is crushed,[.][A]
and he will rise from his bed of rocks and [.]
worms and return to the surface.[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Deep within Darkling Woods, misshapen beasts
roam in ever-growing numbers...[.][A]
as if answering some unheard call.[A]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x151][OpenFarFarRight][LoadFace][0x16A][OpenFarFarRight][MoveMidRight][OpenMidRight]Your Majesty, I bear bad news.[A][CloseSpeechSlow][OpenMidRight]The castle gate has been breached.[A]
Emperor Vigarde's forces are within[.]
the castle walls.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]I understand.[.][A][OpenMidRight]The garrison has fallen.[A]
We've lost contact with Prince Ephraim
and can expect no aid from his men.[.][A]
Your Majesty, what are we to do?[A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]What else can we do?[A]
Order your men to lay[.]
down their arms.[A]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x151][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102][OpenMidRight][MoveRight][OpenRight]Father[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]Eirika.[.][A]

King Hayden is an honorable man.
I trust he will keep you safe.[A][OpenFarRight]Understood.[.][A]
And what of Your Majesty?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Me? I shall remain here.[A]
We have long held Grado among our[.]
dearest allies, yet now, they attack?[.][A]
I must know why.[A][CloseSpeechSlow][OpenMidLeft]Am I somehow responsible for this?
Have I erred in my leadership?[A]
Renais is mine to guide[.][ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]How[.]
could I have failed her so?[.][A][SendToBack][OpenRight][MoveRight][OpenRight]Father, you can't stay! You mustn't![A]
If you remain behind, then so shall I![A][OpenMidLeft]Go now, Seth! Ride![.]

[OpenRight][LoadFace][0x102][OpenFarRight][LoadFace][0x104][OpenRight]Father![.][A][SendToBack][OpenFarRight]Forgive me,[.]
Your Highness.[A]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x151][OpenMidLeft]Ephraim, Eirika[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
You must survive.[.][A]
[0907]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x104][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x106][OpenMidLeft]General Seth![.][A][OpenMidRight]Franz, ride ahead and bring word of our[.]
coming to Frelia.[.][A]
A single rider has better odds of passing[.]
unseen by Grado's men.[A]
Convey to the throne all that has happened
here and petition for reinforcements.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]U-understood![.][A]
[0908]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x104][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102][OpenMidLeft]Princess Eirika, we must[ToggleMouthMove]--[ToggleMouthMove][A]
Quickly! Behind me![.][A]
[0909]
[OpenFarLeft][LoadFace][0x102][OpenLeft][LoadFace][0x104][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x142][OpenMidRight]You there, with the girl. Tell me, would
that be the wayward princess of Renais?[.][A]
Well, this must be my lucky day.[A]
You're a dead man. The wench goes[.]
with me.[A][OpenLeft]Never![A]
[090A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x142][OpenMidLeft]I am Valter, the Moonstone,[.]
Grado's finest general![.][A][Clear]
And you're just a corpse who
does not know he is dead.[.][A]
[090B]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x104][OpenMidLeft]Ahhh[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][Clear]
No![.][A]
[090C]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x142][OpenMidRight]Such terrible wounds, and still[.]
he holds to his duty?[.][A]
How entertaining.[.][A]
Fly away, little man. Fly away.[.]
Try to outrun death.[A]
More time to savor the hunt[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
and the kill.[.][A]
[090D]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x104][OpenMidLeft]Princess Eirika! This way! I can [.]
see no more of Grado's men.[.][A]
If we've made it this far, we've
surely earned a moment's rest.[A]
Please forgive my grabbing you
so[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]brusquely earlier.[A][OpenMidRight]Don't be foolish, Seth.[.][A]
If it weren't for you, I would never
have made it out of the castle.[.][A]
You are the reason I'm still alive.[.]
You have my gratitude.[A][OpenMidRight][MoveRight][OpenRight]And whoever that man was, he was
clearly after me[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
It's my fault that you received[.]
such a grave wound.[.][A]
Allow me to treat it, I[.][ToggleMouthMove]--[ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]Your Highness, I can't allow an injury
like this to be an obstacle.[A]
We have more important matters to[.]
attend to. We must press on to Frelia.[A]
We must fulfill His Majesty's wishes.[.][A][OpenRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
I wonder how my father fares alone in[.]
the castle. Do you think he's safe?[.][A]
And what of my brother on the Grado front?
We've heard nothing from him for days.[A][OpenMidLeft]King Fado and Prince Ephraim are
both valiant and brave men.[.][A]
I doubt even the might of the Grado[.]
Empire can hold them in check.[A]
More important to me, Your Highness, [.]
is that you look to your own safety.[A]
How sad the two of them would be if[.]
something were to happen to you.[A]
We must reach Frelia to ensure the
day of your happy reunion.[A][OpenRight]Yes, of course. You're right.[.][A]
Until I'm reunited with my father[.]
and brother, I must not despair.[A]
Come, Seth. Let us go.[A]
[090E]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x104][OpenMidLeft]Once we cross that bridge, we will
be in Frelia, near Border Mulan.[A]
Let us proceed, Princess Eirika.[A]
[090F]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x102][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x104][OpenMidRight]Your Highness, I won't lie to you.
This will not be an easy ride.[A]
Please, take this rapier.[.]
If something should happen to me,[.][A]
you must continue to Frelia,
alone if need be.[.][A]
[0910]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x130][OpenMidRight]You there! Renais dogs! Where[.]
do you think you're going?[A][OpenMidRight][ClearFace][OpenLeft][LoadFace][0x102][OpenFarLeft][LoadFace][0x104][OpenFarLeft]Grado's men[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
Stand back, Princess Eirika.[A][OpenLeft]It's all right, Seth.[.][A]
My brother has taught me
something of swordplay.[.][A]
I will stand with you.[A]
[0911]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x104][OpenMidLeft]Princess Eirika![A][OpenMidRight]I'm fine. His axe was[.]
slow, and I was quick.[A]
Now it's my turn![.][A]
[0912]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x104][OpenMidLeft]I'll hold the rest of them here.
Please, Princess[ToggleMouthMove]--[ToggleMouthMove]to Frelia![A]
[0913]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x104][OpenMidLeft]All that's left is their leader[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[0914]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x130][OpenMidRight]What was that? Do you think you can[.]
take me, wretched lordling?[.][A]
Come! It's time you high-and-mighty[.]
knights learned to respect a true warrior![A]
[0915]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x104][OpenMidRight]Urgh[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x102][OpenMidLeft]Seth![.][A]
His wounds must be worse
than he let on[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x130][OpenMidRight]Time to die![A][OpenMidRight][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x102][OpenMidLeft]Stop! Face me, if[.]
you have the steel![.][A]
[0916]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x130][OpenMidLeft]You will be the first to die![.][A]
[0917]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x130][OpenMidLeft]What? How?[A]
[0918]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x104][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102][OpenMidLeft]Princess, are you injured?[A][OpenMidRight]What?[.][A]
Oh, no[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][.....]
I'm fine, Seth.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]But you look so pale[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]I'm fine[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]Fine.[.][A]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]This is war, isn't it?[A]
It's not at all like the games I used[.]
to play with my brother or Lyon.[A]
I never thought[.][ToggleMouthMove]-- [.][ToggleMouthMove]I didn't
know it would be this[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]savage.[.][A]
Are words useless? Is strength
all that matters? It's so sad[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
Why would the Grado Empire do this?[.]
To what end would they start a war?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Princess[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]Don't worry, Seth. I won't
give in to sorrow.[A]
Let's get moving.[.][A]
I'm not broken, and I won't stop
until I see Renais restored.[A]
I won't stop until I'm reunited[.]
with my father and brother.[.][A]
[0919]
Your training begins with [ToggleRed]movement[ToggleRed].[.][A]
Place the [ToggleRed]square cursor[.][ToggleRed] on[.]
Eirika and press the [.][ToggleRed]A Button[ToggleRed].[.][A]
[091A]
Press the [ToggleRed]A Button[ToggleRed]
to select Eirika.[.][A]
[091B]

within the [.][ToggleRed]blue area[.][ToggleRed].[.][A]
Move the cursor to the
flashing space beside Seth
and press the [ToggleRed]A Button[ToggleRed].[.][A]
[091C]
You'll now move next
to Seth.[A]
Go ahead and press the
[ToggleRed]A Button[ToggleRed].[.][A]
[091D]
Red units are [ToggleRed]enemy units[.][ToggleRed].[.][A]
After all of Eirika's party has moved,
the [ToggleRed]enemy[.][ToggleRed] units will move.[.][A]
Each side takes turns moving and then[.]
fighting until the battle ends.[.][A]
[091E]
It's time to [.][ToggleRed]attack[ToggleRed]
the enemy.[A]
Place the cursor on Eirika
and press the [ToggleRed]A Button[ToggleRed].[.][A]
[091F]
The cursor is now on Eirika.
Press the [ToggleRed]A Button[ToggleRed].[.][A]
[0920]
Select [.][ToggleRed]Attack[ToggleRed] and press
the [ToggleRed]A Button[ToggleRed].[.][A]
[0921]
This is the [ToggleRed]combat
information window[ToggleRed].[.][A]
You can see the combatant's[.]
[ToggleRed]HP[ToggleRed] and the amount[.]
of damage you will inflict.[.][A]
Eirika should do [.][ToggleRed]7[.][ToggleRed] points,
and the enemy should do [ToggleRed]9[.][ToggleRed].[.][A]
You see the [ToggleRed]x2[ToggleRed] next to
[ToggleRed]Mt[ToggleRed], right?[A]
This indicates that you will
[ToggleRed]attack twice[ToggleRed].[.][A]
Eirika is faster than her[.]
opponent, so she can [.][ToggleRed]strike
twice[.][ToggleRed] in one turn.[.][A]
So, with [.][ToggleRed]2 attacks of 7
points each[.][ToggleRed], Eirika will[.]
do [.][ToggleRed]14 points[.][ToggleRed] of damage.[.][A]
Now press the [ToggleRed]A Button[ToggleRed] to[.]
[ToggleRed]attack[ToggleRed] the enemy.[.][A]
[0922]
On this map you need to defeat
O'Neill, the enemy leader, to win.[A]
The [ToggleRed]objective[.][ToggleRed] is displayed at the [.]
corner of the screen.[.][A]
Your objective changes from map to
map, which may change your approach.[A]
Check your objective before deciding
your strategy. Now, attack the enemy![.][A]
[0923]
Place the cursor on [ToggleRed]Eirika[ToggleRed] and
press the [ToggleRed]A Button[ToggleRed].[.][A]

Move next to the enemy
and press the [ToggleRed]A Button[ToggleRed].[.][A]
[0926]
The [ToggleRed]combat information
window[ToggleRed] is open again.[.][A]
Do you see [.][ToggleRed]Hit[.][ToggleRed] displayed
below [ToggleRed]HP[ToggleRed] and [.][ToggleRed]Mt[ToggleRed]?[.][A]
[ToggleRed]Hit[.][ToggleRed] is the likelihood that[.]
you will land your blow.[A]
Eirika's [.][ToggleRed]Hit[.][ToggleRed] is 94, so she
has a 94 percent chance[.]
of hitting the enemy.[.][A]
[ToggleRed]Crit[ToggleRed], short for Critical, also
appears in this window.[.][A]
This is the chance an attack
will be a lethal strike.[A]
Eirika's [.][ToggleRed]Crit[ToggleRed] is 14, so she
has a 14 percent chance of
landing a killing blow.[.][A]
Critical attacks do [ToggleRed]3 times[.][ToggleRed]
the damage of a normal
attack.[.][A]
Press the [ToggleRed]A Button[ToggleRed] to[.]
attack the enemy leader.[A]
[0927]
Eirika gained over [.][ToggleRed]100[.]
experience points[.][ToggleRed] and
has [ToggleRed]leveled up[ToggleRed].[.][A]
Gaining levels increases [.]
unit abilities and makes [.]
them stronger.[A]
[0928]
You've received a rapier from Seth.[.][A]
All weapons have a [.][ToggleRed]durability[ToggleRed] rating.
The rapier's durability is 40.[A]
Once the rapier has been used[.]
40 times, it will break.[A]
Pay close attention to how many uses
your weapons have remaining.[A]
[0929]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x16A][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x12C][OpenMidLeft]Princess Tana! Grado's
forces are approaching![.][A][OpenMidRight]What? So soon?
Ah, we've had no time![A][OpenMidLeft]Milady, we lack the arms to defend this[.]
place. You must return to Castle Frelia.[A][OpenMidRight]I can't! Not yet. We haven't found
Eirika and her companions yet.[A]
Eirika is my friend, and she needs
my help. I won't abandon her.[.][A]
Oh, I know! Go and ask Father[.][ToggleMouthMove]--[ToggleMouthMove]
I mean King Hayden for more troops.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Yes, Your Highness![.][A][OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidRight]Eirika, please be safe.[.][A][CloseSpeechSlow]
[092A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x16B][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x131][OpenMidLeft]Commander Breguet, the enemy appears to[.]
be fortifying its position in the castle.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Hmph.[.][A]
They're tenacious, but they have
no hope of stopping our advance.[A][OpenMidLeft]What are your orders, sir?[A][OpenMidRight]Ha! Orders? You just stand here and[.]
watch. I'll crush them myself![A][OpenMidLeft]As you command, sir.[A][CloseSpeechSlow]
[092B]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x131][OpenMidLeft]Ha! That's what happens[.]
when you face my lance![.][A]
[092C]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x12C][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x131][OpenMidRight][MoveRight][OpenRight]St-stop right there![A]
Call off your forces and turn back,[.]
or you'll have me to deal with![.][A][OpenMidLeft]Is that so? And[.]
who might you be?[.][A][OpenRight]Who[.][ToggleMouthMove]--? [ToggleMouthMove]I am Tana, Princess[.]
of Frelia.[A]
I will not permit you to abuse
my country any longer.[A][OpenMidLeft]Frelia's royal brat, huh?[.]
How convenient[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenRight]Leave this castle immediately.[A]
If you harm me, my father and brother[.]
will chase you to the earth's end.[A][OpenMidLeft]Yes, I've heard how King Hayden dotes[.]
on his precious little daughter.[A]
Let's see how true that is. You'll
make us a fine hostage, my dear.[A]
Seize the girl and lock her up![.][A][OpenFarRight][LoadFace][0x16B][OpenFarRight]Right away, sir![A][SendToBack][OpenRight][MoveRight][OpenRight]No! Let me go![A]
[092D]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x104][OpenMidRight]Seth, look[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]I see it. It seems like Grado's[.]
army has already reached Frelia.[A]
Princess, this place is perilous.[.][A]
We should bypass Mulan altogether[.]
and head straight to the castle.[A][OpenMidRight]But we can't just ignore this[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][Clear]
You were there when Renais was
invaded[.][ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]You saw what I saw.[.][A]
You saw how the people suffered 
at the hands of Grado's soldiers.[.][A]
Homes were destroyed, possessions[.]
stolen, women kidnapped[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
Anyone who resisted was executed
without question, without hesitation.[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]Please, Seth. I can't allow that
to happen here.[.][A]
I don't want to see any more people[.]
harmed by Grado's atrocities.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]All right, Princess. I understand.
Perhaps we can retake Mulan.[A]
But, Princess, you must act with
caution. Your people need you, too.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Of course, Seth.
Come on! Let's go![A]
[092E]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102][OpenMidRight]Seth.[.][A]
I need to know what's happening here.[.]
I'm going to visit that home.[.][A]
[092F]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x104][OpenMidLeft]Lady Eirika, what are your orders?[A]
[0930]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x131][OpenMidLeft]Hm? Is that the princess of Renais?[.][A]
Ha ha! It really is my lucky day![.]
Fame and fortune ride to meet me![.][A]
Move on, you slugs![.]
Bring that girl to me![A]
[0931]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x106][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x105][OpenMidLeft]Sir Gilliam, is that Mulan? Have
we reached Frelia's border already?[.][A][OpenMidRight]Aye, we have. Her Highness Princess[.]
Tana should be inside the castle.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]But look[ToggleMouthMove]--[ToggleMouthMove]the countryside is
crawling with Grado soldiers![.][A]
Where's the castle guard?[.][.....] Has
Mulan fallen? Are we too late?[A][OpenMidRight]Too tough to say from here.[.][A]
Princess Tana's in no danger if[.]
they want her as a bargaining tool.[.][A]
We men of the Eastern Watch will
see her to safety.[A][OpenMidLeft]Yes[.][ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]Yes, of course.[.][.....]
We mustn't give up. We must move.[.][A]
We must retake the castle. Then, we[.]
ride forth to Princess Eirika's aid.[A][OpenMidRight]I've stronger armor than you do.
I'll take the lead. Watch my back.[A]
[0932]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x106][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x105][OpenMidRight]Thanks, lad.[A][OpenMidLeft]Please, sir[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
When I was a raw recruit, General[.]
Seth taught me something.[.][A]
He said every soldier can serve a[.]
role, even the most inexperienced.[A][Clear]
Wait[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]What is it?[.][A][OpenMidRight][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft]That knight[.][ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]Is that General Seth?[.]
And his companion[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][.....]must be Lady Eirika![A]
[0933]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x106][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x105][OpenMidLeft]Sir Gilliam! Are you all right?[.][A][OpenMidRight]It's just a scratch.[A][OpenMidLeft]Wait! I[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]I have a
vulnerary with me.[A]
Let me give it to you.[A]
[0934]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x16B][OpenMidLeft]I've found them! Stragglers from
Renais! Don't let them get away.[A]
[0935]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x131][OpenMidLeft]Bah, what a worthless lot of
curs I've been assigned![A]
[0936]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x131][OpenMidLeft]This[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]this can't be[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][.....]

[ToggleSmile]But I'm glad to see that
you're safe[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][Clear]
[ToggleSmile]Wait! Where is Ephraim?[.]

hope he's not been harmed[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
Come, we must go to Castle Frelia.
My lord father may know something.[A][OpenFarRight]Thank you, Tana.[A]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x106][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102][OpenMidLeft]Princess Eirika, it is good[.]
to see you're well.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Franz, you made it through unscathed[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]Y-yes, Your Highness![.][A]
I met up with Sir Gilliam of Frelia[.]
and explained the situation in Renais.[A]
He told me that Princess Tana was[.]
in danger as well, here at Mulan.[.][A]
We rode as swiftly as we could.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Tana is here?[.][A]
Franz, we must hurry![.][A][OpenMidLeft]Understood![.][A]
[093A]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x104][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x106][OpenMidRight]Is that you, Franz? I'm relieved
to see you're still in one piece![.][A][OpenMidLeft]Y-yes[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]and you as well, General.[.][A]
As long as you lead us, sir, the
Knights of Renais cannot lose![A][OpenMidRight]Franz, you and I must work together[.]
to protect Princess Eirika.[.][A]
I want you to ride with us.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Sir! With honor, sir![.][A]
[093B]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x15B][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0xFFFF][OpenMidLeft]The rumors are true, aren't they? The[.]
Grado army's taken over the castle.[.][A]
It looks like they've seized the
castle gate, too.[.][A]
Smart work[ToggleMouthMove]--[ToggleMouthMove]the gate provides defense[.]
and heals wounds to boot.[.][A]
They must be fierce warriors to have
taken the gate. Watch yourself.[.][A]
[093C]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x15C][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0xFFFF][OpenMidLeft]That knight encamped at the castle was
wearing the finest armor I've seen.[.][A]
It looked like it could turn aside almost[.]
any blade you swing at it.[A]
I know my armor, though. I wager a good[.]
rapier or armorslayer could get through it.[.][A]
[093D]
The relationship between [.][ToggleRed]swords[ToggleRed], [ToggleRed]lances[ToggleRed],[.]
and [ToggleRed]axes[ToggleRed] is called the [.][ToggleRed]weapon triangle[.][ToggleRed].[.][A]
[ToggleRed]Lances[ToggleRed] are strong against [ToggleRed]swords[ToggleRed].[.]
[ToggleRed]Swords[ToggleRed] are strong against [ToggleRed]axes[ToggleRed].[.]
[ToggleRed]Axes[ToggleRed] are strong against [ToggleRed]lances[ToggleRed].[.][A]
In that last battle, the enemy commander,[.]
Breguet, wielded a [.][ToggleRed]lance[.][ToggleRed], while the[.]
Frelian soldier used a [.][ToggleRed]sword[.][ToggleRed].[.][A]
[ToggleRed]Lances[ToggleRed] are strong against [ToggleRed]swords[ToggleRed],[.]
so Breguet had an advantage.[A]
The [ToggleRed]weapon triangle[.][ToggleRed] can be very
important in determining the outcome of[.]
a battle. For the time being, just[A]
remember that [ToggleRed]lances[ToggleRed] are strong[.]
against [ToggleRed]swords[ToggleRed].[.][A]
[093E]
It's time to [.][ToggleRed]visit[.][ToggleRed] a home. First,[.]
place the cursor on Eirika
and press the A Button.[.][A]
[093F]
The cursor is now on [.][ToggleRed]Eirika[ToggleRed].[.]
Press the A Button.[.][A]
[0940]
Move Eirika to the [.][ToggleRed]house[.][ToggleRed].[.][A]
Place the cursor on the flashing
space and press the A Button.[.][A]
[0941]
You can get [ToggleRed]battle hints[ToggleRed] and
other useful information by[.]
talking to people in homes.[.][A]
This can be very beneficial,
so be sure to visit houses
when you have the chance.[.][A][Clear]
Now select [.][ToggleRed]Visit[.][ToggleRed] and press [.]
the A Button.[.][A]
[0942]
Units on [.][ToggleRed]gates[.][ToggleRed], [ToggleRed]forts[.][ToggleRed], and other special[.]
areas [ToggleRed]recover Hit Points (HP)[.][ToggleRed] at the[.]
beginning of your turn.[.][A]
Currently, the enemy commander, Breguet,
is standing on a [.][ToggleRed]gate[ToggleRed]. Even if he takes
damage, he'll soon [.][ToggleRed]recover some of the[.][ToggleRed]
[ToggleRed]HP[ToggleRed] he lost.[.][A]
[0943]
Starting with this chapter, you will
control not only Eirika, but also Seth,[.]
general of the Knights of Renais.[.][A]
You select and move him in the same way[.]
you do Eirika: by placing the cursor
on him and pressing the A Button.[.][A]
When all of your units have finished
moving, your enemy's turn will begin
[ToggleRed]automatically[.][ToggleRed].[.][A][Clear]
If Eirika, the leader of your group, falls
in battle, [.][ToggleRed]the game is over[ToggleRed].[.][A]
You can choose to continue playing if any[.]
of your allies fall, but defeated allies
will [.][ToggleRed]never fight at your side again[ToggleRed].[.][A]
Try to move forward with the fewest[.]
number of casualties possible.[A]
[0944]
Allied units have joined the battle.[A]
All allied blue units can be moved
in the same manner as Eirika.[.][A]
[0945]
You defeated Breguet, commander[.]
of Grado's forces in Mulan.[.][A]
All that remains is to [.][ToggleRed]seize[.][ToggleRed] the [.]
castle gate.[A]
Only your [ToggleRed]commander[.][ToggleRed] can perform
this task.[A]
The commander of this group is Eirika.
Move her to the castle gate, [.][ToggleRed]seize[.][ToggleRed] [.]
it, and clear this map.[.][A]
[0946]
It's time to [.][ToggleRed]trade[.][ToggleRed] items. First,
place the cursor on Gilliam and[.]
press the A Button.[.][A]
[0947]
The cursor is on [.][ToggleRed]Gilliam[.][ToggleRed].[.]
Press the A Button.[.][A]
[0948]
Now select [.][ToggleRed]Trade[.][ToggleRed].[.][A]
[0949]
Here are the items Gilliam
and Franz are carrying.[.][A]
Move the cursor to Franz's
items on the right side.[A]
Press [ToggleRed]right on the
+ Control Pad[.][ToggleRed].[.][A]
[094A]
Use the [ToggleRed]+ Control Pad[.][ToggleRed] to select
a [ToggleRed]vulnerary[.][ToggleRed] and press the [.]
A Button.[.][A]
[094B]
Press the A Button now to accept
the [ToggleRed]vulnerary[.][ToggleRed] from Franz.[A]
[094C]
The item has successfully been traded.[A]
Press the [ToggleRed]B Button[ToggleRed] to finish [.]
your transaction.[.][A]
[094D]
You can use the [ToggleRed]vulnerary[.][ToggleRed]
you received right away.[A]
Select the [.][ToggleRed]vulnerary[.][ToggleRed] from[.]
your [.][ToggleRed]items[.][ToggleRed] and use it.[A]
[094E]
Place the cursor on [ToggleRed]Seth[ToggleRed] and
press the A Button.[.][A]
[094F]
The cursor is now on [.][ToggleRed]Seth[ToggleRed].[.]
Press the A Button.[.][A]
[0950]
Seth must move near his[.]
foe. Press the A Button.[A]
[0951]
This is the [ToggleRed]combat
information window[ToggleRed].[.][A]
At the top of the window,[.]
next to Seth's name, is a[.]
[ToggleRed]weapon[ToggleRed] and an [ToggleRed]arrow[.][A]
pointing up[.][ToggleRed]. This is because[.]
Seth has a [.][ToggleRed]sword[.][ToggleRed], while[.]
the soldier has an [.][ToggleRed]axe[.][ToggleRed].[.][A]
The [ToggleRed]weapon triangle[.][ToggleRed] states[.]
that [.][ToggleRed]swords[ToggleRed] are strong[.]
against [ToggleRed]axes[ToggleRed].[.][A]
Seth is at an advantage.[A]
[0952]
The enemy has an [.][ToggleRed]axe[.][ToggleRed], so it's[.]
best to counter with a [.][ToggleRed]sword[.][ToggleRed].[.]
Choose [.][ToggleRed]Attack[ToggleRed] and press
the A Button.[.][A]
[0953]
Move the cursor to an unoccupied
space on the map, and press the 
A Button to open the [.][ToggleRed]map menu[ToggleRed].[.][A]
The third item from the top is
[ToggleRed]Guide[.][ToggleRed]. Try selecting it.[.][A]
The guide contains lots of useful 
[ToggleRed]game-play information[.][ToggleRed].[.][A]
If you run into something that
seems unclear, review the [ToggleRed]guide[.][ToggleRed]
for a quick reference.[A]
[0954]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x102][OpenFarRight][LoadFace][0x108][OpenRight][LoadFace][0x107][OpenMidLeft]Seth has mapped out a route for us.[.][A]
We'll travel south of Renais and pass[.]
through Serafew into Grado territory.[.][A][OpenRight]Hmm[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
That would seem a sensible plan.[A]
Assuming, of course, that we can avoid
any run-ins with Grado soldiers[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenFarRight]Princess Eirika, may I have your leave
to scout ahead?[.][A]
From the sky, I'll have a better chance[.]
of spotting any nearby troops.[A][SendToBack][OpenRight]We're yours to command, Your Highness.
Will you give your permission?[A][OpenMidLeft]Yes, of course.[.][A]
Keep an eye out for enemy[.]
bowmen though, Vanessa.[.][A][OpenFarRight]Yes, Your Highness, I shall.[A]
I shall prove myself worthy[.]
of the honor of your trust.[.][A][OpenFarRight][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft]She seems very[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]sincere.[A][OpenRight]Sincere[.][ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]Yes, quite.[.][A]
[0955]
[OpenRight][LoadFace][0x132][ToggleSmile][OpenRight]Hey, boss! We've found more[.]
villages ripe for the picking.[A][OpenFarLeft][LoadFace][0x133][OpenFarLeft]One, two, three[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][.....]
Ha ha ha! I love a good war![A]
With all those soldiers preoccupied,
we're free to pillage as we please![.][A]
Right, Bone[.][ToggleMouthMove]--[ToggleMouthMove]you're in charge.[.][A]
Grab everything that's not nailed[.]
down and bring it to the hideout.[.][A][OpenRight]I'm on it.[A][CloseSpeechSlow]
[0956]
[OpenFarLeft][LoadFace][0x109][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x10E][OpenFarLeft][MoveMidLeft][OpenMidLeft]Dad!
Bandits approaching![A][OpenMidRight]Hmmm[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
I'm getting you out of here,
Ross. You stay close to me![.][A]
[0957]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x132][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]Let's start with that village there!
Go to it, boys! It's all yours.[.][A]
Cut down anyone fool enough to get
in your way.[A]
I'm heading west around the[.]
mountains to the other villages.[A]
[0958]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x109][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x10E][OpenMidLeft][MoveMidLeft][OpenMidLeft]Unnnng![.][A][OpenMidRight]Ross? What is it?[.]
What's wrong?[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]It's nothing! It's just a scratch![A]
You're a warrior, Dad, and I am your
son. I won't be beaten so easily.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]Don't risk yourself so foolishly[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
We need to get you some help.[.][A]
Please! Someone help my son![A]
[0959]
[OpenFarLeft][LoadFace][0x108][OpenFarLeft]Ah! This looks serious.[.][A]
I must report back to[.]
Princess Eirika at once.[A]
[095A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x102][OpenFarFarRight][LoadFace][0x108][OpenFarFarRight][MoveRight][OpenRight]I have bad news.[A]
The village to the east is
under attack by bandits.[A][OpenMidLeft]Bandits?![.][A][OpenFarRight][LoadFace][0x107][SendToBack][OpenFarRight]We have arrived at our first dilemma.[.][A]
We must move quickly and attract as[.]
little attention as possible, but[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]But I cannot stand by and watch[.]
innocents be harmed.[A]
Vanessa, how fare the villagers?[A][OpenRight]I spotted one injured person.[.]
He appeared to be just a child.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Father Moulder, can[.]
your staff help him?[A][OpenFarRight]Well, yes, I can heal his[.]
injuries with my staff, but[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
I cannot do it from here. He's
too far away. I must be near him.[.][A][OpenRight]Princess, please leave this to me.[A]
I shall bring the boy here.[.][A]
[095B]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x108][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x107][OpenMidRight]All right, Vanessa.[.]
It's up to you.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Very well. I'm off.[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ClearFace]
[095C]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x102][OpenMidLeft]I'll head for the nearest village[.]
and warn them about the bandits.[A]
[095D]
[OpenFarLeft][LoadFace][0x108][OpenLeft][LoadFace][0x109][SendToBack][OpenLeft][MoveLeft][OpenLeft]Hey![A][OpenFarLeft]Calm down, lad. Keep squirming,[.]

side of these mountains.[A][OpenLeft][MoveLeft][OpenLeft]Wait! Dad![A][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x10E][OpenMidRight]Don't worry about me. Go![.][A]
I'll hold these scum here.
Take care of Ross![A][OpenLeft][MoveLeft][OpenLeft]DAD![A]

[OpenFarRight][LoadFace][0x108][OpenRight][LoadFace][0x109][SendToBack][OpenFarRight]I've brought the boy.[.][A]
Father Moulder, please
heal his wounds.[A]
[095F]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x107][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x109][OpenMidRight][MoveMidRight][OpenMidRight]My wound[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]It's gone![A][OpenMidLeft]Yes, it is. Now try to keep[.]
yourself out of harm's way.[.][A]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x132][OpenMidLeft]Wait a minute!
Wh-who are you?[.][A]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x132][OpenMidLeft]Urgh[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]Blast[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[0962]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x10E][OpenLeft][LoadFace][0x104][OpenFarLeft][LoadFace][0x102][SendToBack][OpenMidRight]You saved my son.[.]
I owe you my thanks.[A][OpenFarLeft]It's not necessary[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenLeft][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]Hold on a moment[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
Aren't you[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]the great Garcia?[.]
You fought for Renais, didn't you?[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenFarLeft]Seth, do you know this man?[.][A][OpenLeft]He was a troop commander for Renais[.]
until around ten years ago.[.][A]
When I was a recruit, the soldiers
used to tell so many tales about him.[.][A]
They called him a daring and fearless[.]
fighter for Renais.[.][A][Clear]
Master Garcia, you must know the peril
our homeland faces right now[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
Can we impose upon you to lend your[.]
strength to Renais once again?[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]I'm sorry. I'm retired now.[.][A]
I'm not a soldier anymore. It's[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
a decision I made long ago.[.][A][OpenLeft]Master Garcia[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]When I was a soldier, I lived my
life fighting for my country's honor.[.][A]
I left no time for my family.[.][A]
I spent my life fighting for faceless,
uncaring nobles.[A][Clear]
When my wife fell ill and died, I met[.]
the child she had left behind[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
At that moment, I finally realized
what my duty had cost me.[.][A][OpenFarLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]I stood at my wife's grave and promised[.]
her I would be a father to our son.[.][A]
I'm done with armies. I'm done with[.]
fighting, except to protect my son.[.][A]
I've no regrets. I'm the boy's father.[A][OpenLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenFarFarLeft][LoadFace][0x109][OpenFarLeft][ClearFace][OpenLeft][ClearFace][FastPrint2][OpenFarFarLeft][MoveMidLeft][OpenMidLeft]You[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]you blasted fool![.][A]
Father, what's all this[.]
nonsense I'm hearing?[.][A][OpenMidRight]Ross![.][A][OpenMidLeft]If you're not going, then I will![.][A]
I'm a fighter!
I know I can do this![.][A][OpenMidRight][MoveRight][OpenRight]Ross, what are you saying?
I[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]Dad, please! Listen to me![A]
I respect you more than any[.]
other man in the world.[.][A]
I know you gave up being a
soldier for me. I know that![A]
But how can you throw away
such a big part of yourself?[A]
You're a warrior at heart! You [.]
can't give that up and be happy![A][OpenRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]Look at me, Dad!
Have you seen me fight?[.][A]
I'm not a child anymore.
I'm a warrior, like you.[A]
You're free to worry, but 
I can survive on my own![A][OpenRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]Ross.[.][A][OpenMidLeft][MoveMidLeft][OpenMidLeft]You want to challenge me, Father?[.][A]
I'm a fighter! The best in all of Ide![A]
I'm not gonna lose to you!
I'm not gonna lose to anyone![.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]You're right.[.][A]
You're a good soldier, Ross.[A][CloseSpeechSlow][OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenLeft][LoadFace][0x102][OpenFarLeft][LoadFace][0x104][OpenRight]Sir Seth[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
If these old bones of mine can
still serve, I'd like to join you.[A][OpenFarRight][LoadFace][0x109][OpenFarRight]Dad[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenRight]Looks like my boy grew up while[.]
I wasn't looking[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
He's tougher than I thought.
He doesn't need my help.[A]
I've raised him as best I could, [.]
but he's right.[.][A]
I've nothing to fear. I should [.]
fight. I will fight.[A][OpenFarRight]Dad![A]
[0963]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x102][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x158][OpenMidRight]Thank you so much for your help.
Please, stay the night and rest[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]We would if we could, but we have[.]
much to do and far to travel.[.][A]
Your safety is reward enough.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Ah, well[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][Clear]
My, that is a splendid
bracelet you're wearing.[A][OpenMidLeft]Thank you. My father
gave this to me.[A][OpenMidRight]It's a wonderful gift.[A]
But you should be careful, wearing
such a valuable item so openly.[.][A]
Since Renais was invaded, things have[.]
become so dangerous around here.[A]
There are gold-hungry thieves and[.]
bandits everywhere.[.][A][Clear]
The most wicked are Bazba's Bandits.
They are[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]cruel beyond words.[.][A]
If you have something they want, your[.]
life is worth less than nothing.[A]
Just the other day they assaulted some
travelers and[.][ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]Oh, it was awful.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]I[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]I can't believe such things[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]Oh, Renais is finished, mark my words.
The Grado Empire's stolen our future.[.][A]
Our only hope against them was that[.]
Prince Ephraim would prevail, but[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
Rumor has it that he's on the verge of
being crushed by Grado's vast numbers.[A]
These are dark days. Travel with care.[A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[0964]
[OpenLeft][LoadFace][0x102][OpenLeft]Ephraim[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[0965]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x12E][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x12D][OpenMidLeft]It's time to start.[.]
Are you ready, Eirika?[A][OpenMidRight]Yes, Ephraim.[.]
Let's begin.[A][OpenMidLeft]Tell me, though: why do you want
me to teach you to fight?[.][A]
I thought you didn't care for[.]
violence[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]I do not like uncivilized behavior.[.][A]
I think one can solve one's problems
without fighting.[.][A]
And yet[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]And yet what?[.][A][OpenMidRight]I've always relied on you to
protect me, Brother.[A]
I would rather not be such a
burden to you in the future.[A]
So, I thought maybe I should
learn to protect myself[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]I'm your brother. Brothers are
supposed to protect their sisters.[A]
It's nothing for you to worry about.
It's no cause for concern.[A][OpenMidRight]Yes, but[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
I am your sister. Sisters are supposed
to worry about their brothers.[A][Clear]
So I would like to learn something of[.]
swordplay, if only a little.[A]
And maybe, someday, I can protect you[.]
in your time of need[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
So please, Ephraim.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]All right, all right. How could I say no?[.][A]
Honestly, once you get an idea into your
head, that's it. I might as well give in.[.][A][Clear]
It's agreed. I'll teach you, but won't
hold back because you're my sister.[.][A]
And I want no complaining once we've
started, Eirika.[A][OpenMidRight]Complain? Me? Never![A]
[0966]
[OpenLeft][LoadFace][0x102][ToggleSmile][OpenFarFarLeft][LoadFace][0x10C][OpenLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenFarFarLeft][MoveFarLeft][OpenFarLeft]Oops! Beg your pardon.[A][OpenLeft][MoveLeft][OpenLeft]Hey![A][OpenFarLeft][MoveFarFarRight][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x104][OpenMidRight]Princess, are you all right?[A][OpenLeft]Y-yes[.][ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]Someone bumped into[.]
me is all. I was jarred.[A][OpenMidRight]Hm?[.][.....]
Your Highness, where is your bracelet?[A][OpenLeft]My bracelet?
It's[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]gone.[.][A]
Where could it be?
Did that man[ToggleMouthMove]--[ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]I'll find him![A][OpenLeft]Don't worry about it, Seth.[.][A]
That bracelet was a gift from my
father, but Ephraim needs our help.[.][A]
I can't let sentimentality get in[.]
the way of my duty.[.][A][OpenMidRight]No, Princess... We must retrieve [.]
your bracelet regardless of cost.[.][A]
You cannot lose it. Let's go.[.]
We must hurry.[A]
[0967]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x102][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x109][OpenMidRight]Hey, listen! My village is
being attacked by bandits.[A]
My name's Ross.[.][A]
Come on! You have to help[.]
me wipe those thugs out![A][OpenMidLeft]All right, just[.][ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]Just take a[.]
deep breath and calm down, Ross.[A]
Leave the villages to us.[.]
We'll drive off the bandits.[A]
Seth, take the boy somewhere safe.[A][OpenMidRight][MoveMidRight][OpenMidRight]No! Wait! I'm going[.]
to fight, too![A][OpenMidLeft]But[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]My father is out there all alone,[.]
fighting those bandits.[.][A]
I've got to get back to him as
quickly as possible![A]
I'm the son of the great Garcia![A]
As long as I have my axe, no
bandit will ever defeat me![.][A][OpenMidLeft]All right, I can see you're[.]
not going to be swayed[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
But you must promise you
will stay close to us.[A]
[0968]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x109][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x10E][OpenMidLeft][MoveMidLeft][OpenMidLeft]Dad![A][OpenMidRight]Ross?! Boy, what did I tell[.]
you!? What are you doing here?[A]
Don't worry about me. Hurry up
and get yourself to safety![.][A][OpenMidLeft]Did you really think I could just[.]
run away while you fight, Dad?[A]
You taught me that fighters fight[.]
for what's important to them![.][A]
There's no way I'm leaving![.]
I'm fighting just like you![.][A][OpenMidRight]Ross[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
All right, listen to me. We'll cut
our way out of here together![.][A]
[0969]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x160][OpenFarFarLeft][LoadFace][0x102][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x13F][OpenMidLeft]This is terrible[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]What are we going[.]
to do? Those bandits are so close.[A]
If we can't find some way to protect
ourselves, the village is doomed.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Perhaps[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x102][OpenMidLeft]People, listen to me! You must close
the village gates immediately.[A]
Hurry, before the bandits arrive![.][A][OpenMidRight]Who are you? You aren't from one

You're no peasant.[A][OpenMidLeft]I am Er[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
My name is Erina.[.]
I'm a mercenary.[A][OpenMidRight]A mercenary named Erina, is it?[.][A]
There's more to you than that, I feel.
But don't worry[.][ToggleMouthMove]--[ToggleMouthMove]it's none of my affair.[.][A]
I haven't told you who I am yet, have I?
I am Selena, a general in Grado's army.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Ah![.][A][OpenMidRight]Is something wrong?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]No[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]uh, nothing.[A][OpenMidRight]It looks like these villagers[.]

I would like to help, but[.]
I have orders[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
I'm to leave for the capital
immediately, and I cannot stay.[.][A]

a mercenary. Will you help them?[A][OpenMidLeft]Um[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]Is there a problem?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]No! Of course I'll help them![.][A]
It's just[.][ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]You're one of[.]
Grado's generals[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]Why[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]These aren't soldiers.
They're people.[.][A]
Should they suffer because
their leaders fight?[A]
I've petitioned your aid.[.]

[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x15A][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0xFFFF][OpenMidRight]Hm? What is it? What's
all the ruckus?[.][A]

Bazba's Bandits keep their lair nearby.[.][A]

I had no idea[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
Burning our villages[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]Stealing from[.]
our people with no fear of reprisal?[A][OpenMidLeft]It wasn't always like this. The knights[.]
used to protect the citizenry[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
However, with Renais in ruins and her army
tattered, law and order are hard to find.[.][A]
It doesn't look like the Grado army is

If nothing changes, Renais will continue
this sad plunge into savagery.[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]

a village named Lark[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]

Um, Colm's my[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]uh[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]We've known[.]
each other since we were kids.[A]

Don't worry. We'll find your friend[.]

Oh, thank you! Thank you!!![.][A]
I[.][ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]I don't have much money,

to the bandits' lair as well[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
Well, it seems as though we share[.]
a common cause with Neimi.[A]
She is a citizen of Renais, after all.[A]
And isn't it our duty to defend our[.]
countrymen?[.][A]
I'm only sad that we weren't here to

So, yes, I feel we must help her.[.][A][OpenFarRight]Very well. Neimi, I trust[.]
you can lead the way?[.][A][OpenLeft]Er, yes[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][.....]
It's this way.[A]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x102][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x104][OpenMidRight]It figures. The doors are locked.[.][A]
With no keys and no thief to pick[.]
the locks, we're stuck outside.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]I see. We're at an impasse
then, aren't we?[A][OpenMidRight]Actually[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]No, we're in luck.
You see that wall there, milady?[A][OpenMidLeft]Yes, I do. It's cracked[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]That's right. A few well-aimed blows

[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x10A][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x104][OpenMidLeft]Um[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]Is there anything I can do
to help? I feel so[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
When I was little I used to go
hunting with my grandfather.[A]
What I mean is I can[ToggleMouthMove]--[ToggleMouthMove]
I'm not bad with a bow.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Really?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Uh-huh.[.][A][OpenMidRight]I see.[A]

I'm not bad with a bow.[.][A][OpenRight]A bow?[A][OpenMidLeft]Uh-huh.[.][A][OpenRight]What do you think, Seth?[A][OpenFarRight]An archer would come in handy[.]
in tight quarters like these.[.][A]
With a good bow, we could attack
from afar without fear[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenRight]Well, Neimi, can you take[.]
orders and keep out of danger?[A][OpenMidLeft]I[.][ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]I'll try, Your Highness.[A]

Remember, use your axes to hit 'em

They can't hurt what they can't hit!
Now, get out there and cut 'em up![A]

I could've robbed these bandits blind[.]
on my own, thank you very much.[.][A][OpenMidLeft][HalfCloseEyes][OpenMidLeft]I was[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][.....]

look at this.[.][A][OpenMidLeft][MoveLeft][OpenLeft]Hm?[.][A][OpenRight]I got your mirror back.[.][A]
Remember how you cried when we left[.]
Lark? You thought you'd lost this.[A]
I knew it was your mother's, and I
knew those thugs had taken it.[A]
So I went and got it back![A]
See what happens when you give

off! Please, Neimi[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenFarLeft][LoadFace][0x104][OpenFarLeft][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]This is quite touching, but[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]

can't just leave us here.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Pardon?[.][A][OpenRight]Neimi and I[.][ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]We've got no home[.]
to return to.[.][A]
No matter where we go, there's
just gonna be more fighting.[A]
You're mercenaries, right?
Well, then take us with you.[A]
I'm a handy guy to have around.[.]
I know I can help you out.[A][OpenMidLeft]I would prefer not, but I'll agree
with Eirika's decision.[.][A]
Our duty is a grave one however. We've
no time to waste shepherding you.[.][A] [.][OpenRight]That's fine with us.[A]
You just wait[.][ToggleMouthMove]--[ToggleMouthMove]I promise you[.]
won't regret your decision.[.][A]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x102][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x104][OpenMidRight]I retrieved your bracelet from
the bandits' stronghold.[A]
Here you are, Princess.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Thank you, Seth.[A]
You know[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]Father gave me this[.]
bracelet when I was a child.[A]
It has only one match in the
world, and my brother wears it.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Lady Eirika, you must take care never to
lose that bracelet.[.][A]
It is the proof that King Fado entrusted
the future of Renais to you, his children.[A][OpenMidLeft]Seth[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]What is it you're[.]
not telling me?[.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]I apologize, Your Highness.[.][A]
When the time comes, I will tell
you what I know. Until then, I[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]I see.[A]
If you tell me it must wait,
then it can wait. I trust you.[A][OpenMidRight]Then we should get moving again.[A]
We're safe from bandits for now,
but I can't guarantee for how long.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]This[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]This is just the beginning,[.]
isn't it?[.][A]
If we hope to free our homeland, it[.]
will take battle after battle[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]I'm afraid so, Your Highness.[.][A]
The day you and Prince Ephraim win back[.]
the freedom and honor of Renais will come.[A]
But I fear it lies at the end of a long[.]
and treacherous road.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]I know. I must fight for that day.[A]
In the names of all those I could[.]
not save, I'll lead us home.[A]
Let's go. My brother awaits![A]

Tell me, how fares the campaign[.]
in Renais?[A][OpenMidRight]Signs of chaos abound.[A]
Brigands ride without fear, and[.]
the peasants' cries fill the air.[.][A][OpenFarLeft]Hmm[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
If Grado's troops do not enforce public[.]
order, the situation will only worsen.[A]
And still, His Majesty has given us[.]
no orders.[A]
Perhaps, just this once, I should[.]
take the lead[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenLeft]What could His Majesty be thinking?[.][A]
Breaking our long-held alliance with
Renais[ToggleMouthMove]--[ToggleMouthMove]invading without warning[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
He's never been this way before. He[.]
abhors violence.[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenLeft]And have you noticed the recent[.]
promotions? Who are they going to?[A]
Certainly not to the soldiers who[.]
have Grado's best interests at heart.[.][A]
I fear this invasion is the prelude[.]
to a much larger war.[.][A]
I feel as though His Majesty is no
longer the man we knew him to be.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Glen, it doesn't matter what any
of us might think of our orders.[A]
We are his servants, and we will not
question His Majesty's intentions.[A][OpenLeft]I know that, Selena.
And yet[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenFarLeft]That's enough. Both of you.[.]
His Majesty summons us.[.][A]
Let's hope we can learn a[.]
little during our audience.[.][A]

wherever I send you.[A][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x125][OpenMidRight]By your command.[A][OpenMidRight][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x13F][OpenMidRight]In Your Majesty's name.[.][A][OpenMidRight][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x14B][OpenMidRight]Yes, sire[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]However, I know this[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
You, my Imperial Three, lack the strength[.]
to conquer the remaining nations alone.[.][A]
In the invasion of Renais, certain
soldiers performed beyond expectation.[A]
I have chosen them to join you as[.]
new generals in the empire's service.[.][A]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]Come.[.][A]
[0999]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x140][OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]The performance of these
men surpassed even your own.[A]
With the addition of these three[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
The empire will have six generals[.]
strong enough to conquer this land.[.][A]
Do you understand?[A][OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x148][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Heh heh heh[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[ToggleSmile]I am Riev, given the name[.]
Blood Beryl by His Majesty.[.][A]
I know I am a newcomer, but[.]
I pray for your favor.[A][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x125][OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]Understood.[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x143][OpenMidRight]I'm Caellach. I was a mercenary,
fighting in the desert.[.][A]
Seems I'm to be called
Tiger Eye[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
You're a fine-lookin' lass, aren't you?[.]
Yeah, I'm gonna love working with you.[A][ToggleSmile][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x13F][OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x142][OpenMidRight]So we meet again. You know me as General
Valter, but you will call me the Moonstone.[.][A]
I'll save you worthless dogs from your
own incompetence. You'll thank me later.[A][OpenFarFarLeft][LoadFace][0x14B][OpenFarFarLeft][MoveFarLeft][OpenFarLeft]Valter[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]You scum![.][A][OpenLeft][LoadFace][0x125][OpenLeft]Peace, Glen.[A][OpenLeft][ClearFace][OpenFarLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x140][OpenMidLeft]Selena. Caellach. You will
bring me Frelia.[A][OpenRight][LoadFace][0x13F][OpenFarRight][LoadFace][0x143][OpenRight]Yes, sire.[A][OpenFarRight]Sure. Good as done.[.][A][OpenRight][ClearFace][OpenFarRight][ClearFace][CloseSpeechSlow][OpenMidLeft]Riev. Duessel. You are charged with[.]
the defense of the empire.[A]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]I will speak to you individually
with more details later.[A][OpenRight][LoadFace][0x148][OpenFarRight][LoadFace][0x125][OpenRight][ToggleSmile]Heh heh heh[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
[ToggleSmile]Understood, Your Majesty.[.][A][OpenFarRight]By your command, sire.[A][OpenRight][ClearFace][OpenFarRight][ClearFace][OpenRight][LoadFace][0x142][OpenRight]And me?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Valter, Glen[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
I have other duties for you[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenFarRight][LoadFace][0x14B][OpenFarRight]Yes, Your Majesty?[A][CloseSpeechSlow][OpenMidLeft]Renais has fallen, but Princess Eirika
still eludes us[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
Her brother, Prince Ephraim, leads
a resistance within our borders.[A]
Bring the siblings to me.[.][A][OpenRight]Ha ha[.][ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]Of course.[A][OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenFarRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[099A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x10A][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x10C][OpenMidLeft]C-Colm[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight][MoveMidRight][OpenMidRight]Neimi?![.]
What are you doing here?[A]
I told you to wait for me,
didn't I?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]I couldn't[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]It's too dangerous.[.][A]
C'mon, let's go home.[.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]We don't have a home! Don't you get it? 
Look, just leave everything to me.[A]
I can take care of it in a flash, but I don't[.]
need a clumsy oaf like you tagging along.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]But[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]but[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]Oh, this is ridiculous.[.][A]
We'll talk later. Don't[.]
leave my side, Neimi.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]I[.][ToggleMouthMove]-- [.][ToggleMouthMove]All right.[A]
[099B]
[ToggleRed]Walls[.][ToggleRed] with cracks in them can be[.]
attacked and destroyed.[.][A]
Once a wall is destroyed, you can pass
through the opening you've created.[.][A]
When your way seems blocked, be sure
to check all the [.][ToggleRed]walls[.][ToggleRed].[.][A]
[099C]
The bandits' [.][ToggleRed]hand axes[.][ToggleRed] can be used
in both [ToggleRed]direct[ToggleRed] and [.][ToggleRed]indirect combat[.][ToggleRed].[.][A]
They can be wielded like normal axes
in direct, hand-to-hand combat[A]
or thrown to strike enemies who are[.]
a space away or at an angle to you.[.][A]
Like bows, they can also hit enemies
on the [.][ToggleRed]other sides of walls[ToggleRed].[.][A]
[099D]
The [ToggleRed]thief[.][ToggleRed] Colm has appeared.[.][A]
Thieves can [ToggleRed]steal[.][ToggleRed] items from[.]
other units.[A]
Also, they can [.][ToggleRed]open the locks[ToggleRed] of[.]
[ToggleRed]doors[.][ToggleRed] and [.][ToggleRed]chests[ToggleRed]. Thieves[.]
are handy allies to have around.[A]
[099E]
Place the cursor on a unit and press
the [ToggleRed]R Button[ToggleRed] to display that
unit's [.][ToggleRed]status[ToggleRed].[.][A]
For example, if you select a bandit[.]
and press the [ToggleRed]R Button[ToggleRed], you'll
see that he's carrying a hand axe.[A][Clear]
If you press the [.][ToggleRed]R Button[ToggleRed] again,[.]
you'll see [.][ToggleRed]help information[ToggleRed] for each[.]
item on-screen.[.][A]
You can use the [ToggleRed]R Button[ToggleRed] to see[.]
the properties of weapons and items.[A]
If there's something you don't [.]
understand about [.][ToggleRed]unit information[ToggleRed], 
press the [ToggleRed]R Button[ToggleRed].[.][A]
[099F]
Bows are [.][ToggleRed]ranged weapons[ToggleRed].[.]
They can be used to attack enemies
who are a space away.[.][A]
Additionally, they can be used
to attack over walls.[.][A]
[09A0]
Colm and Neimi are childhood friends.[.]
Try moving Neimi next to Colm and[.]
have her [.][ToggleRed]talk[ToggleRed] to him. He[.]
may decide to join you.[.][A]
[09A1]
Colm and Neimi have an [.][ToggleRed]invisible[.]
bond[ToggleRed] that ties them together.[.][A]
Units that have such a bond can[.]
develop a [ToggleRed]support relationship[ToggleRed].[.][A][Clear]
Units become closer and their bond
stronger the longer they are
[ToggleRed]adjacent to one another[.][ToggleRed].[.][A]
Eventually, they will be able to
share a [ToggleRed]support conversation[ToggleRed].[.][A][Clear]
Units that share a support relationship[.]
fight with [.][ToggleRed]improved abilities[ToggleRed]
when they are near each other.[A][Clear]
There are three levels of support[.]
units can share: [.][ToggleRed]C, B, and A[.][ToggleRed].[.][A]
Levels are gained by staying
side-by-side as much as possible.[.][A][Clear]
Colm and Neimi are not the only units[.]
that can have support relationships.
Eirika and Seth, among others, can [.]
grow close to other units as well.[A][Clear]
Watch how characters interact with each[.]
other to guess at who might share[.]
a support relationship with whom.[.][A][Clear]
If you have two units you think may[.]
have such a bond, [ToggleRed]place them next[.]
to one another again and again[ToggleRed].[.][A]
Who knows: they may eventually share
a [ToggleRed]support conversation[ToggleRed].[.][A][Clear]
However, bear in mind that each unit
can have only [ToggleRed]5[.][ToggleRed] support relationships.[.][A]
[09A2]
Enemy units may sometimes drop items
when they are defeated.[.][A]
In the same way you searched for hand[.]
axes earlier, try looking at enemy items
with the [.][ToggleRed]R Button[ToggleRed].[.][A]
[ToggleRed]Green items[.][ToggleRed] are items that will be 
dropped. Check enemy items beforehand 
to gain the advantage in combat.[A]
[09A3]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x104][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x102][OpenMidRight]We're approaching Serafew, at the[.]
border of Renais and Grado.[.][A]
Once we cross, we'll be in Grado[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][.....]
Renvall won't be much farther.[A][OpenMidLeft]That is, assuming we can cross the
border without mishap[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
Oh![.]
Look! Over there![.][A]
[09A4]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x104][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x102][OpenMidLeft]Those strange figures[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][.....]
What[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]What are they?[A]
Are they[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]human?[A][OpenMidRight]I've never seen anything like[.]
it. What could they be?[.][A]
[09A5]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x110][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x11A][OpenMidRight]What have we done to deserve the trials[.]
before us? What is happening to us?[.][A]
How could such abominations walk our lands
while the Sacred Stones protect us?[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]Lute, please, it's dangerous outside
the walls. Stay here in the village.[A][OpenMidLeft]Those are revenants, aren't they?[.][A]
They were the vanguard of the Demon[.]
King in the days of darkness.[.][A]
The Tome of Nazania describes them in[.]
chapter 2, section 7, paragraph 8.[A][OpenMidRight]You know of them?[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Duh! I'm a prodigy. I can recall
most everything I see or hear.[A]
According to the book, revenants
attack using razor-sharp claws.[.][A]
Sounds painful, wouldn't you say?[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]Yes, er, well[.][ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]Be that as it may, I
must go aid those travelers outside.[A]
You should stay here within the[.]
safety of the village.[A][OpenMidLeft]Very well. I don't mind staying here.[.]
In fact, it seems the smarter choice.[.][A][CloseSpeechSlow][OpenMidRight][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft]Magic is far more powerful than any[.]
monster's claws.[A]
The thickest hide and strongest armor[.]
are useless against magic's power.[A]
Yes, I suppose I could have studied[.]
swords, but only magic is worthy of me.[.][A]
Even if this village were to be assaulted[.]
by monsters, I could defend it perfectly.[.][A]
[09A6]
[OpenLeft][LoadFace][0x102][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x11A][OpenMidRight]Travelers, you must listen to me! The[.]
ancient forest of Za'ha is dangerous.[.][A]
Head south and pass through this place
before the fiends surround you![.][A][OpenLeft]Who are you?[A][OpenMidRight]My name is Artur.[.][A]
The temple has assigned me the task of
cleansing the forest of these[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]things.[.][A]
There are so many of the fiends, though.
I wonder if I stand much chance alone.[A]
So if you would, please flee now while
you have the chance.[A][OpenLeft]Fiends?[.][A]
You're not talking about the same fiends
that served the ancient Demon King?[.][A]
That can't be right[.][ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]They're nothing[.]
but legends and fairy tales[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]Yes, I felt the same when I heard.[A]
And yet here they are. This place[.]
is filled with them.[A]
I wonder how far they've spread[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
Surely they're not in Renais alone.[.][A][OpenLeft]But[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]why are they here? How?[.][A][OpenFarLeft][LoadFace][0x104][OpenFarLeft]Beware, Your Highness!
Something approaches![.][A]
[09A7]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x11A][OpenMidLeft]Please allow me to deal with this.[A][CloseSpeechSlow][OpenMidLeft]Evil shade! May the blessed light[.]
drive you from this land![.][A]
[09A8]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x104][OpenMidLeft]We ought to help. He can't fight
them all alone. Do you have orders?[.][A]
[09A9]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x11A][OpenMidLeft]One of my companions is in that village[.]
to the south.[.][A]
If any of you can get there swiftly,
I implore you to watch over her safety.[.][A]
[09AA]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x11A][OpenMidLeft]Listen to me, travelers! If you[.]
can, try to stay in the woods.[A]
[09AB]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x102][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x104][OpenMidLeft]Why should we stay in the woods?[A][OpenMidRight]In combat, the trees provide
cover against attacks.[A]
The trees and branches make it
difficult for enemies to strike.[A][OpenMidLeft]Is that so? Fair enough.[A]
Let's stick to trees then.[A]
[09AC]
[ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x122][OpenMidRight]Oh, my![.][A]
Those travelers are besieged
by the agents of evil![A][OpenLeft][LoadFace][0x123][OpenLeft]Ha ha ha! Right you[.]
are, Lady L'Arachel![A][OpenMidRight]I cannot allow this to happen!
Come![.][A]
We must charge down these cliffs
and rush to their aid![A][OpenFarLeft][LoadFace][0x124][OpenFarLeft]We charge down these cliffs, and the
only thing we'll be rushing to is death.[A]
How about we find us a nice, gentle[.]
path down, hm?[A][OpenMidRight]Ah[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]Yes, well[.][ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]Let us
hurry nonetheless.[A]
I simply cannot abide those[.]
wicked beasts running amok![.][A]
[09AD]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x11A][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x110][OpenMidRight]Everything is all[.]
right now, Lute.[A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]Lute?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Your flesh shows no sign of putrefaction.[.][A]
It seems you're not a revenant.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Well, I should hope not![A][Clear]
However, I'm obliged to help the ones[.]
who aided me against those fiends.[A]
So I'm afraid I'll be leaving you and[.]
traveling with them for a while.[A]
What will you do, Lute?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]That's a good question. A very good[.]
question indeed. Hmm[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
It's decided. I'll join you, Artur.[.][A]
After all, who wouldn't appreciate the
help of a mage such as myself?[A]
[ToggleSmile]There's no one better than me.[A][ToggleSmile]
[09AE]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102][OpenFarFarLeft][LoadFace][0x110][OpenFarFarLeft][MoveFarLeft][OpenFarLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]Yes? Who are you?[.]
What do you want?[.][A][OpenFarLeft]Your flesh shows no sign of putrefaction.[.][A]
It seems you're not a revenant.[.][A][OpenMidRight]I most certainly am not.[A]
Are you from this village? It's[.]
still not safe to travel outside.[.][A][OpenFarLeft]I am not a villager. I am Lute. I'm[.]
a mage! Possibly the best, in fact.[.][A]
I've decided to join you and your crew
in gratitude for your help here today.[A]
After all, who wouldn't appreciate the
help of a mage such as myself?[A]
[ToggleSmile]There's no one better than me.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]What an unusual girl[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]

[OpenLeft][LoadFace][0x104][OpenFarLeft][LoadFace][0x102][OpenRight][LoadFace][0x11A][OpenFarRight][LoadFace][0x110][SendToBack][OpenLeft]We've killed all the monsters.[A]
Still, we'd best burn the bones to
ash to be sure they don't return.[.][A][OpenFarLeft]I still can't believe what we've
been fighting here[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
I'd thought those fiends nothing
more than myth and legend.[A][OpenLeft]Those revenants are said to be the
least of the dark creatures.[A]
And yet, the weakest of them could
outmatch any normal man.[A]
We cannot take this enemy lightly.[A][OpenFarRight]Oh, yes. There are much worse than those
revenants and the entombed[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
Let's see, there's the bonewalkers,[.]
mauthe doogs, gargoyles, baels[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
Why, I'll bet you just about any creature[.]
of lore could be walking again.[.][A]
Yes, we're in for some trouble. Even my[.]
fabulous power may not be enough.[.][A][OpenRight]O divine light, show me[.][ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]Is this[.]
a sign of dark days to come?[A][OpenFarRight][ClearFace][OpenRight][ClearFace][OpenLeft][ClearFace][FastPrint2][OpenFarLeft][MoveMidLeft][OpenMidLeft]By all that's holy,[.]
what is happening?[A][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x104][OpenMidRight]Princess Eirika, perhaps it would be
wise to return to Frelia and regroup.[.][A]
Pressing forward seems foolish in[.]
light of recent events.[.][A]
We cannot face both Grado's forces
and more of those terrible things.[A][OpenMidLeft]Seth, I follow your point, and nothing would
please me more than running for safety.[.][A]
But what of my brother? He and his men
are trapped in the same situation we are.[.][A]
I know full well that I may be leading us[.]
into even greater danger, but[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
Please try to understand.[.][A][OpenMidRight]I do, my princess, and I vow to[.]

Since you ask, please allow me

mustn't continue![.][A]
You cannot reveal your

so careless sometimes![A]
Now, I must ride off in anonymity.
Oh, how beautifully romantic![.][A][OpenMidLeft]Uh[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]Right.[A][OpenRight]Fare thee well, strangers.
Perhaps our paths will cross again.[.][A]
Come, Dozla! Rennac!

I wanted you to know help has arrived.
Please be patient a bit longer[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]No, no. I insist on joining you in combat.[A]
I've been reading up on these revenants.
They are, quite simply, no match for me.[A]

There are still monsters about,[.]

My name is Lute. I'm a mage of superior[.]
wisdom and rare ability.[A]

I've decided to join you in battle now.[.][A]
My name is Lute. I'm a mage of superior[.]

I've been reading up on these revenants.
They are, quite simply, no match for me.[A]
[ToggleSmile]I am superior after all.[A][ToggleSmile]
[09B5]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0xFFFF][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x15B][OpenMidRight]Do you see that old snag to the[.]
south of here?[A]
Bet it would make a handy bridge
if you could knock it over.[.][A]
Take a weapon to it and give it a[.]
few good whacks. That should do it.[.][A]
Here, take this and give it a try.
It ought to do the trick.[.][A]
[09B6]
There are three different schools of
[ToggleRed]magic[.][ToggleRed], each of which is governed[.]
by the [.][ToggleRed]trinity of magic[ToggleRed].[.][A]
[ToggleRed]Light[.][ToggleRed] is strong against [.][ToggleRed]Dark[ToggleRed].[.]
[ToggleRed]Dark[ToggleRed] is strong against [.][ToggleRed]Anima[.][ToggleRed].[.]
[ToggleRed]Anima[.][ToggleRed] is strong against [.][ToggleRed]Light[.][ToggleRed].[.][A]
For now, just remember that [ToggleRed]Light[.]
is strong against Dark[ToggleRed].[.][A]
[09B7]
The [ToggleRed]magic[.][ToggleRed] that Artur and Lute
wield cannot be stopped by
physical [.][ToggleRed]defense[.][ToggleRed].[.][A]
However, magic [.][ToggleRed]resistance[ToggleRed] can affect[.]
the damage it does.[.][A]
So, it's possible to do high damage to
units like [.][ToggleRed]knights[.][ToggleRed], who possess[.]
strong [.][ToggleRed]defenses[ToggleRed].[.][A]
On the other hand, it's difficult to harm[.]
units with high [ToggleRed]resistance[ToggleRed], like
pegasus knights.[A]
Magic can also be used to attack
directly or indirectly, like a hand axe.[A]
It can be wielded like a sword to strike
adjacent foes or like a bow to hit
enemies at a distance.[A]
[09B8]
Starting on this map, you'll be able
to use the [.][ToggleRed]preparations screen[.][ToggleRed].[.][A]
You can [ToggleRed]choose which units[ToggleRed] to send into[.]
battle and [.][ToggleRed]manage items[ToggleRed] to secure
the best chance of victory.[.][A]
[09B9]
Forests and other map areas may[.]
offer [ToggleRed]terrain bonuses[.][ToggleRed].[.][A]
Units in forests are harder to hit
and take less damage when struck.[.][A]
Simply put, staying under trees makes[.]
it more difficult for enemies to hit [.]
and harm you.[.][A]
Areas that have [ToggleRed]terrain bonuses[.][ToggleRed] are
[ToggleRed]forests[.][ToggleRed], [ToggleRed]mountains[.][ToggleRed], [ToggleRed]fortresses[ToggleRed], and[.]
[ToggleRed]gates[.][ToggleRed], to name a few.[A]
Use terrain to your advantage during
combat to avoid risking your units.[.][A]
[09BA]
[ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x12A][OpenMidLeft]Well, well. There's an arena in this town.[A]
Perfect. My pocket's feeling a bit light.[.][A][CloseSpeechSlow][OpenMidLeft]Say, is that a cleric? It is![.]
And a gorgeous one at that.[.][A]
[09BB]
[OpenLeft][LoadFace][0x111][OpenLeft][MoveRight][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x12A][OpenMidLeft]Something amiss, Sister?
You look flustered.[.][A][OpenRight][MoveRight][OpenRight]Ahhh![.][A][OpenRight][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x111][OpenMidRight]P-pardon me.[A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]No, pardon me! I never meant
to startle you.[.][A]
May I offer my apologies[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]No, it's not necessary[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
It was my fault.[A]
Excuse me, I must be going[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
Good day to you.[A][OpenMidRight][ClearFace][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]And there she goes.[.][A]
Not my lucky day[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
She was quite the beauty, too.[A]
Ah, such is life. I think I've time[.]
still to visit the arena, though.[.][A]
[09BC]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x134][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x14B][OpenMidRight]Captain Saar of the Serafew Border
Guard. How fare you?[A]
I bring orders from His Majesty.[A]
Rumor has it that Princess Eirika of
Renais is making her way to Grado.[A]
You are to find her and to place
her in custody immediately.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Yes, sir![.][A][OpenMidRight]One more thing[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
A traitor to the empire has fled
Castle Grado.[.][A]
We've received reports she is hiding
somewhere here in Serafew.[A]
I don't care if you have to tear this[.]
town apart. Find the turncoat.[A][OpenMidLeft]Yes, sir, General Glen![.][A]
If she resists, do we have
permission to execute her?[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]Yes. Permission granted.[A][OpenMidLeft]Understood! Grado's will be done.[.][A]
The Grado Empire will repay the[.]
debt of betrayal with blood![A][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]His Majesty relies upon you, Captain.[.]
Be sure his trust is not misplaced.[.][A]
That is all.[A][OpenMidLeft]Yes, sir![.][A]
[09BD]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x113][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x14B][OpenMidRight]Such loyalty to the crown.[A]
If only I could hold such conviction
in the righteousness of our emperor.[A][OpenMidLeft]Something troubling you, Brother?[.][A][OpenMidRight]No[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]Pay no mind to me.[A]
Come, Cormag. Let's go.[.][A]
From here, we ride northeast,[.]
back to the fort.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Very well.[A]
[09BE]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x102][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x104][OpenMidLeft]It's been so long since I last
visited Serafew.[A]
My brother and I used to pass[.]
through here en route to Grado.[.][A]
I remember the harmony in which the[.]
people of both countries lived.[.][A]
No walls divided our borders. No
soldiers stood guard in high towers.[A]
This border town[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]It was to me a symbol[.]
of the trust between Grado and Renais.[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]And now, it is firmly under[.]
the thumb of Grado's emperor.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]The peace I remember in this city[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
It seems like something from another
time. It seems lost now[.][ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]Forever.[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]The city doesn't seem to be very
heavily patrolled.[A]
They must feel it's not worth guarding
with Castle Renais under their control.[.][A]
We must try to not draw attention to
ourselves. The west gate is undermanned[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][LoadOverworldFaces][OpenFarFarRight][LoadFace][0x120][OpenFarFarRight]Pardon me, may I ask
you a question?[.][A][OpenMidRight][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][MoveFarLeft][OpenLeft][LoadFace][0x104][OpenFarFarRight][MoveMidRight][OpenFarLeft]What is it?[.][A][OpenMidRight]I'm looking for someone.[A]
Have you seen a young girl
with indigo hair?[.][A][OpenFarLeft]Indigo hair?[A]
No[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]Sorry.[A][OpenMidRight]Hmmm[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
Thank you. Sorry
to intrude.[.][A]
[09BF]
[OpenLeft][LoadFace][0x102][OpenFarLeft][LoadFace][0x104][OpenLeft]There was something very odd about
that man, wouldn't you say?[.][A][OpenFarLeft]He did seem unusual. He didn't
strike me as a Grado spy, but[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][LoadOverworldFaces][OpenFarFarRight][LoadFace][0x16B][OpenFarFarRight]Catch her! Don't let her escape![A][CloseSpeechSlow][OpenFarFarRight]That way! She[.]
went that way![A][OpenLeft]What's that?[A][OpenFarLeft]It's coming from over there.[A][OpenLeft]Let's see what the commotion is.[A]
[09C0]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x111][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x16B][OpenMidRight]Traitor Natasha!
Surrender peacefully.[.][A]
Come quietly, and you may have the chance[.]
to explain yourself before His Majesty.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Wait, please.[.]
You must listen to me![A][OpenMidRight]Take her.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]No, you must believe me![A]
The emperor is not himself. You[.]
MUST be able to see that![.][A][OpenMidRight]Impugn the emperor at your peril![.][A]
We've been ordered to execute you[.]
if you offer any resistance.[A]
But your words condemn you![.][A]
[09C1]
[OpenLeft][LoadFace][0x102][OpenFarLeft][LoadFace][0x104][OpenLeft]That cleric is a traitor to[.]
the throne of Grado?[A]
What madness is this?[.][A]
[09C2]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x111][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102][OpenMidLeft]Ah[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]Are you all right?[A][OpenMidLeft]Who are you?[A][OpenMidRight]I'm from Renais. Why are
these Grado men after you?[A][OpenMidLeft]You're from Renais[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]Oh![.][A]
I have something I must tell
you. It's about Grado[.][ToggleMouthMove]--[ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]Wait[ToggleMouthMove]--[ToggleMouthMove]Grado soldiers are coming[.]
this way.[.][A]
We'll have to talk later.[.]
Now we must fight![A]
[09C3]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x12A][OpenMidRight]So much for my dreams of making[.]
my fortune here[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
First the girl, now the gold.[.]
It really isn't my lucky day.[.][A][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x16B][OpenMidLeft]You there! Mercenary! What are
you doing here at the arena?[A]
Get back to the staging area now![.][A][OpenMidRight]C'mon, why don't we both hit the arena?[.]
It'll be good training.[.][A]
If you're going to risk your life anyway,[.]
you may as well try to earn some gold.[A][OpenMidLeft]I'm reporting you to the captain! You'll
be lucky if he just docks your pay![.][A]
Don't forget[ToggleMouthMove]--[ToggleMouthMove]you can be replaced in
an eyeblink, you filthy sellsword![A][OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidRight]Don't worry, little man.
I won't forget.[.][A][Clear]
Work's work, but I don't
like fighting women[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
Now then, what's the rest of
the day got in store for me?[A][Clear]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]Tails, huh? That's nothing
but bad luck and more bad luck[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[09C4]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x111][OpenMidLeft]They may not want to hear what
I have to say, but[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
I must speak with one of the
Grado soldiers.[.][A]
Oh, if only one of them will
listen to my words[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
Please! Grant me strength.[A]
[09C5]
[OpenFarRight][LoadFace][0x14C][OpenFarRight]Look at this. Now's our chance![.][A]
C'mon, lads![A]
Let's join the fight and steal our
way through this pathetic town![.][A]
[09C6]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x111][OpenMidRight]I can't let myself die here[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
Someone has to hear my tale[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[09C7]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x134][OpenMidLeft]Enemy of the empire![....]
Death's too good for you![.][A]
[09C8]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x134][OpenMidLeft]Emperor Vigarde[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
Glory to His[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]Majesty[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[09C9]
[OpenLeft][LoadFace][0x102][OpenFarLeft][LoadFace][0x104][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x111][SendToBack][OpenLeft]That was a tight spot.[A][OpenMidRight]Yes, yes it was[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
Thank you so much.[A]
I don't know how to repay[.][ToggleMouthMove]--[ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenFarLeft]You're from Grado, aren't you?[A][OpenMidRight]Yes[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
My name is Natasha.[.][A]
I was a servant of the people[.]
at Grado's Imperial Temple.[.][A][OpenLeft]Then why the trouble with the soldiers?[.]
Would you tell us your story?[.][A][OpenMidRight]Of course[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
A few days past, my mentor was [.]
arrested without warning.[.][A]
They executed him.
They said he was a traitor[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
But those were false accusations.[.][A]
The emperor had him killed[ToggleMouthMove]--[ToggleMouthMove]a holy
man![ToggleMouthMove]--[ToggleMouthMove]to keep him silent.[.][A][OpenFarLeft]Keep him silent?[A][OpenMidRight]Yes. My mentor told me with[.]
his final breath.[.][A]
The emperor plans to destroy
the Sacred Stones.[A][OpenLeft]The Sacred Stones? Destroy them?[A][OpenMidRight]As you must know, the Sacred Stones drove[.]
back the power of evil long ago.[A]
Even now, each of our nations is home[.]
to one of these legendary treasures.[A]
There's one in my homeland, Grado, and
one in your Renais[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenLeft]Yes, the Sacred Stone of Renais is
still housed in our royal temple.[.][A][OpenMidRight]The emperor plans to destroy the
five stones, one by one[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenFarLeft]Why would he do such a thing?[.][A]
Legend says the Sacred Stones are[.]
even now all that keeps evil at bay![A][OpenMidRight]I cannot begin to guess his motives[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
You must know, our emperor was a gentle[.]
man. But one day, he changed. Utterly.[A]
Before my mentor died, he said the keepers
of the Sacred Stones must be warned.[A]
I tried to slip across the border, but
the soldiers spotted me[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenLeft]Is that what happened[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
What do you think, Seth?[A][OpenFarLeft]I think we can trust no one from Grado.[.]
Not in these times. Not without proof.[A]
However, if what she says is true, we[.]
cannot ignore the danger we face.[.][A]
Destroying the Sacred Stones[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
We cannot allow that to happen.[.][A][OpenLeft]I agree. If only we knew if there were
some reason for the emperor's actions.[A]
I must tell you, her story chills me to[.]
the bone. I pray it is false[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[09CA]
[OpenFarLeft][LoadFace][0x104][OpenLeft][LoadFace][0x102][OpenRight][LoadFace][0x112][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]Ahh[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenLeft]Hold on! You must hold on![A][OpenFarLeft]Her wound is[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenRight][HalfCloseEyes][OpenRight]The[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]emp[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]emperor[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenLeft]Stop, you mustn't speak[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenRight]The emperor wants[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]de[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
destroy[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][.....]
Sacred Stones[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenRight][CloseEyes][OpenFarLeft]What?![A][OpenLeft]Destroy the Sacred Stones?[A][OpenRight][HalfCloseEyes][OpenRight]Please[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]warn[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
Protect the[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]five stones[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]

Seth, what do you make
of her final words?[.][A][OpenFarLeft]She said something about the
Sacred Stones.[A]
She must have meant five stones that
banished evil from Magvel long ago.[.][A][OpenLeft]And the emperor[.][ToggleMouthMove]--[ToggleMouthMove]Grado's emperor?
Is he trying to destroy them?[.][A]
What does that mean?[A][OpenFarLeft]I don't know.[.][A]
If she had lived, we might
have learned more, but[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenLeft]Destroying the Sacred Stones[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
We cannot allow that to happen.[.][A]
Could it really be true? What would[.]
drive the emperor to such madness?[A]
I must tell you, her story chills me
to the bone. I pray it is false.[A] [.]
[09CB]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x158][OpenMidLeft]A moment, please.[.]
Are you perchance[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
Princess Eirika?[A][OpenMidRight]I am.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Oh[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]Thank goodness you're safe![.]
I can't tell you how happy I am.[A]
And please accept my gratitude for
driving off that Captain Saar.[A]
That Saar treated all the citizens of Renais
with such contempt and brutality[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]Not here[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]not in this city.[.][A]
My brother and I spent such[.]
happy times here with Lyon[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]I beg your pardon, but it will not be[.]
long before Grado sends more troops.[A]
Please, you must go quickly.[A][OpenMidRight]I'm so sorry.[.][A]
There's nothing I can do for
you now. Please forgive me.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Do not be troubled.[.]
Princess Eirika[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
We will survive and wait for the
day of liberation to come.[A]
There will come a day when you, Prince
Ephraim, and all of Renais rise up[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
Until that day of glory comes, we will
wait unbowed and filled with hope.[A]
[09CC]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x111][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x12A][OpenMidLeft]You[.][ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]You're that man I met[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
Are you here to capture me? You've been[.]
hired to silence me, haven't you[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]Yeah, Grado's paying the bill.
They want you dead, you know?[.][A]
But don't feel bad. It's not personal.[A][OpenMidLeft]Wait, please[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
It doesn't matter what happens to[.]
me, but you must hear my words.[.][A]
The emperor of Grado is changed.
He is not the man he once was.[A]
The other nations must be warned before[.]
he extinguishes all light from our lands.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Hey, no offense, but I'm just a mercenary.
I don't care about Grado or its emperor.[A]
Everything you say may be true, or it may[.]
be lies. I don't care either way.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]But that's[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]Even so[.][ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]Killing a beautiful lady like[.]
you would leave a bad taste in my mouth.[A][Clear]
Tell me, do you like to gamble?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]What?![A][OpenMidRight]Gambling's what I live for. Even
when I lose, I never want to stop.[A]
Let's have us a little wager.[.]
If you win, I'll believe you.[.][A]
Heads or tails, you call it.[A][OpenMidLeft]You can't[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
This is no time for games[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]Would you rather I get on with the
job I was hired for?[A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove]
Um, heads[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
No! Tails![A][OpenMidRight]All right. So I'm heads,
and you're tails.[.][A]
Here we go.[.][.......]
[ToggleMouthMove]... ... ...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove]
Which[.][ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]Which is it?[A][LoadOverworldFaces][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]What do you know?![A][Clear]
It's tails. You win. Figures.[.]
I haven't won anything all day.[.][A]
Well, Lady Luck has spoken.[.]
Guess I'm on your side now.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Are you serious?[A][OpenMidRight]Yeah. Sure, I might cheat, but I never
worm out of a bet. It's a rule of mine.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Oh, thank heaven! Thank you, blessed
light, for your protection![.][A][OpenMidRight]I got nothing against heaven, but I'm right[.]
here if you want someone to thank[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
No? Well, get behind me then. I've
got to take care of these fools.[A]
[09CD]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x158][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0xFFFF][OpenMidLeft]Life in Serafew's been harder since the[.]
Grado occupation force took over here.[A]
Serafew's got Renais citizens as well as
Grado, but it's been hardest on us.[.][A]
They've singled out families from[.]
Renais for the most awful atrocities.[.][A][Clear]
Please, traveler, take this sword.[A]
It's an armorslayer. It'll cut through
even the strongest armor.[.][A]
Take it and strike down that
blackheart, Saar.[.][A]
[09CE]
[ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x11C][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0xFFFF][OpenMidLeft]Oh, hello.
Did you come to see me dance?[.][A]
I'm sorry, but I just finished a
few moments ago.[A][Clear]
Oh, by the way[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]Would you be interested[.]
in one of these items?[A]
A wealthy patron left me a small ransom[.]
in gifts after watching my performance.[.][A]
You can sell one for gold if you'd like[.]
or use them to improve your skills.[.][A]
I simply cannot carry all of this by
myself, so please, take this one.[.][A]
Wealth is useless if you can't use it[.]
to bring happiness to others, right?[A]
Thanks for dropping by. Perhaps we'll[.]
meet again someday.[.][A][OpenMidLeft][Wink]
[09CF]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x159][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0xFFFF][OpenMidLeft]In my youth, I was a knight of some[.]
renown, I'll have you know.[.][A]
I've even crossed blades with one of
Grado's most famous generals, I have.[.][A]
Ah, but I'm an old man now[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
I'm starting to worry[.][ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]What if I die[.]
without passing on my techniques?[.][A]
So I decided to write down what I've
learned in a book. I have it here.[A]
You seem like a strong warrior. I'd[.]
be honored if you would accept it.[A]
[09D0]
[ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x119][OpenMidLeft]Hope everyone's well back home in Silva.
Just a bit more, and I'll be in the empire.[.][A]
Let's see, I've got vulneraries,
antitoxins[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
Oh! And I can't let myself forget torches[.]
for when it gets dark.[A]
Yep! I'm all set![.]
Now I just need to get to the capital.[A]
I'll be the finest soldier the
Grado army's ever seen! I swear it![.][A][OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0xFFFF][OpenMidRight]Hm?[.][....] What's this[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[09D1]
Sometimes, you can talk to an enemy and[.]
convince him to join you.[.][A]
For example, right now, [ToggleRed]Joshua[ToggleRed] might
be inclined to talk with [.][ToggleRed]Natasha[.][ToggleRed].[.][A][Clear]
However, [.][ToggleRed]Joshua[ToggleRed] is a [ToggleRed]red unit[ToggleRed].[.][A]
Unlike green units you've seen before,
he will [ToggleRed]attack[ToggleRed] until he's spoken to.[A]
Moreover, [ToggleRed]Joshua[ToggleRed] is a [ToggleRed]myrmidon[ToggleRed], who[.]
specializes in [.][ToggleRed]critical hits[.][ToggleRed].[.][A]
If you are struck by a [.][ToggleRed]critical hit[ToggleRed], you[.]
will suffer 3 times the normal damage.[A]
It's a good idea to check [ToggleRed]Crit[ToggleRed]
on the combat information window.[.][A]
[09D2]
You got an armorslayer.[.][A]
This weapon is similar to rapiers in
that you can severely injure knights
and generals with a single blow.[A]
In such cases, the weapon icon on the[.]
combat information window will flash.[.][A]
[09D3]
There's an [.][ToggleRed]armory[ToggleRed] and a
[ToggleRed]shop[ToggleRed] in this city.[A]
[09D4]
[ToggleRed]Armories[ToggleRed] sell iron swords, steel
lances, and other weapons.[A]
[ToggleRed]Shops[.][ToggleRed] carry spells, vulneraries,[.]
and a myriad of other items.[A]
If you're running short on anything,
make sure you stock up here.[A]
[09D5]
There's an [.][ToggleRed]arena[.][ToggleRed] here.[A]
[09D6]
Arenas play host to [ToggleRed]one-on-one
combat matches[ToggleRed].[.][A]
If you win a match, you'll earn [ToggleRed]twice[.]
the amount of the entry fee[.][ToggleRed].[.][A]
If you lose, however, that unit [ToggleRed]will not
be able to fight in any future battles[ToggleRed].[.][A]
If your HP drops near zero in a fight,
[ToggleRed]press the B Button quickly[ToggleRed] to concede.[A]
You'll lose your entry fee, but you'll
save your unit to fight again.[A]
[09D7]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x138][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x142][OpenMidLeft]What a pleasant surprise.[.]
It's Master Valter.[.][A][OpenMidRight]What's the situation, Tirado? You[.]
have captured Ephraim, haven't you?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]No. Prince Ephraim still fights[.]
in the lands north of Renvall.[A][OpenMidRight]And why is that?[A]
What has happened to all
those mercenaries you hired?[A][OpenMidLeft]They've proven to be less than adequate.[A]
Ephraim's clever. His band strikes quickly
and then vanishes into the woods.[.][A]
We more than double his numbers, and yet
he uses the terrain wisely to fight us.[.][A]
He has no army[ToggleMouthMove]--[ToggleMouthMove]just a small force
of knights loyal to Renais.[.][A]
Prince Ephraim's reputation as a superb[.]
strategist would seem to be well earned.[A][OpenMidRight]Hmm[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
How interesting. The lad's beginning
to whet my appetite.[A]
Tirado[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]Bring him to me as quickly
as you can, will you?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]As you command.[.][A]
Just grant me an army, and
I'll bring him down swiftly.[A][OpenMidRight]What sort of plan do you have?[A][OpenMidLeft]Master, I am your loyal adjutant,[.]
and you are my general.[.][A]
For you, my lord, I have many[.]
plans ready and waiting.[A][OpenMidRight]Really? Well then,
let me hear them.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Very well. [.][A]
First, you and I will leave this
fort and head north.[A]
Then, we will find Prince Ephraim[.]
in his leafy playpen.[.][A][OpenMidRight]But he's not easily found, is he?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Do not worry.[.][A]
At Prince Ephraim's side is[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
a friend, shall we say.[.][A]
When the time is right, our friend
will move on our behalf[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[09D8]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x114][OpenRight][LoadFace][0x116][OpenFarRight][LoadFace][0x118][SendToBack][OpenMidLeft]Forde, how are we on
supplies and equipment?[.][A][OpenRight]It's not looking good.[A]
Our weapons are in bad shape,[.]
and we're running low on food.[A]
We can probably restock at a
nearby village, but[.][ToggleMouthMove]--[ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]No, that's not an option.[.][A]
We're in enemy territory. I will not
involve innocents if I can avoid it.[A][OpenRight]Yeah, I knew you'd say that.[A]
I mean, it's because of stuff like that[.]
that we've stuck with you so far.[.][A]
But eventually, we do need to face
reality. What are we going to do?[.][A][OpenFarRight]Word of mouth has it that the invasion
of Renais has progressed quite far.[.][A]
I've heard that the capital has fallen.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Hm[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]So soon[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
Still, my father is in the capital,[.]
and he won't surrender easily.[A][Clear]
Forde, Kyle.[A]
Our mission here is to harry the
troops, to distract their eye.[A]
Hopefully, we'll be able to give my[.]
father and Eirika time to escape.[.][A][CloseSpeechSlow][OpenMidLeft]Kyle, have you heard anything from
Orson? I sent him ahead to scout.[.][A][OpenFarRight]No word yet, and it's about[.]
time he returned[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenRight][ClearFace][OpenFarRight][ClearFace][FastPrint2][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x145][OpenMidRight]Reporting in, Prince Ephraim.[.][A]
I can confirm Grado presence at[.]
several points around our camp.[.][A]
Also, a large battalion of soldiers[.]
has been dispatched from Renvall.[.][A]
We shouldn't tarry here any longer
than necessary[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]I see.[A][OpenMidRight][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x116][OpenMidRight]Seems as though we've certainly[.]
caught Grado's eye this time.[.][A]
Should we retreat back to the[.]
capital, Prince Ephraim?[A][OpenMidLeft]No. We press onward.[A]
We're going to capture Renvall.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Wh-what?!?[A]
[09D9]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x114][OpenRight][LoadFace][0x116][OpenFarRight][LoadFace][0x118][OpenMidLeft]So this is Renvall, is it?[A]
All right, let's go.[A][OpenRight]Um[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]Are you[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]sure you're[.]
quite sane, Prince Ephraim?[.][A]
We've an entire army after us, and
you want to charge their stronghold?[A][OpenFarRight]Forde! Watch your tongue! This [.]
is our prince you're addressing![A][OpenMidLeft]Kyle, please, it's all right.[.]
We've heard nothing from home,[A]
so what harm could a little[.]
reckless besieging cause?[.][A][OpenFarRight]Prince Ephraim[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]Don't worry. I haven't lost all sense[.]
of self-preservation.[.][A]
Renvall holds an important place in[.]
Grado's national defense.[.][A]
If we can get the upper hand
and take control of it,[.][A]
then Grado will waste many valuable[.]
soldiers trying to take it back.[A]
I hope our attack proves useful[.]
to my father and Eirika.[A][SendToBack][OpenRight]I understand what you're saying, but[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
can we do it with our current strength?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Every soldier in this area is[.]
trying to find us.[A]
The enemy has us vastly outnumbered.
Attacking the castle is a ridiculous idea.[A]
If the enemy thinks the same[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
then we may have our opening.[.][A][OpenRight]You have a point. I'm sure Renvall won't
expect us to attack with these numbers.[.][A]
Either way, we can't run forever.[.]
And we're running out of supplies.[A]
What've we got to lose?[.]
Shall we get ready to go?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Yes. If we don't move quickly, we[.]
may never get another chance.[.][A][Clear]
Trust me. I don't pick fights I[.]
cannot win.[.][A][OpenFarRight]Yes, sir![.][A]
[09DA]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x135][OpenMidLeft]An attack? By Ephraim's troops?[.][A]
To arms! Prince Ephraim's circled around
and brought the fight to us![A]
If we capture the prince here, we can[.]
line our pockets with gold![.][A]
Do you understand? We'll be rich![.][A]
[09DB]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x114][OpenMidLeft]Orson.[A][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x145][OpenMidRight]Yes[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]Your wounds still haven't healed
from that last battle, have they?[.][A]
Don't push yourself.[A]
If we're defeated, you must return
to Frelia. Understood?[A][OpenMidRight]Understood[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]Let's go![.]
Kyle! Forde![A]
[09DC]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x116][OpenMidRight]Oh, that hurt[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
I'm sorry, Prince Ephraim.
I have to fall back.[A]
[09DD]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x118][OpenMidRight]I was careless[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
My apologies, Prince Ephraim.[.][A]
I must withdraw.[A]
[09DE]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x145][OpenMidRight]This wound[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
It will slow me down.[.][A]
I must retreat.[.][A]
[09DF]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x135][OpenMidLeft]Do you truly think you can take[.]
us with those numbers?[A]
Imbecile! You'll learn the
error of your ways![.][A]
[09E0]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x135][OpenMidLeft]L-Lord Tirado[.][ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]It can't be[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
Were we[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]merely pawns?[.][A]
[09E1]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x114][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x118][OpenMidRight]We've secured the entire castle.[A]
You were brilliant, Prince Ephraim![.]
What a plan! What a battle![.][A][OpenMidLeft]I estimate at least half of the[.]
enemy troops are in the field.[A]
We took the castle, but we don't have the[.]
manpower to hold it in a siege.[.][A]
There's no point in lingering here.[.]
Let's continue on to Grado Keep.[A]
[09E2]
[OpenLeft][LoadFace][0x114][OpenFarLeft][LoadFace][0x118][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x116][SendToBack][OpenMidRight]Prince Ephraim, things have[.]
taken a turn for the worse.[.][A]
I took a look around the castle perimeter[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][Clear]
We're surrounded.[.][A][OpenFarLeft]What?[.][A][OpenLeft]Grado's sent reinforcements?
So quickly[ToggleMouthMove]...?[ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenFarLeft]What should we do?[A][OpenLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A][Clear]
We must escape![.][A]
[09E3]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x114][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x142][OpenMidLeft]So, you've captured Renvall, have you?
And with such a small force! Impressive![A]
You've earned your reputation. I must say,
I quite admire your work.[.][A][Clear]
I take it you're the leader of this[.]
pack[ToggleMouthMove]--[ToggleMouthMove]the misguided Prince Ephraim.[.][A][OpenMidRight]I am.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]I'm General Valter, the Moonstone[.]
of Grado's Imperial Army.[.][A]
Catching up to you has caused me
no small amount of trouble.[.][A]
We've reduced your wretched home
of Renais to ruin, and yet[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
you and your little band of bravos
continue to be a thorn in our side.[.][A][Clear]
But that all ends here.[.][A][OpenMidRight][MoveRight][OpenRight]We'll see[.][ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]You claim you've
taken the capital of Renais[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
Tell me, how did you know[.]
I would attack Renvall?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Ha ha[.][ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]Patience. You'll have[.]
your answer soon enough.[A]
Now, be good lads, and drop[.]
your weapons, will you?[.][A][OpenFarRight][LoadFace][0x118][OpenFarRight]Prince Ephraim, let us attack![A][OpenRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]Listen to me, Ephraim. You're a smart[.]
man. You know it's futile to fight me.[A]
You cannot win.[.]
You cannot escape.[A]
Accept the reality of your situation,[.]
and surrender to me.[A][OpenRight]Surrender?[A][OpenMidLeft]Heh heh heh[.][ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]That's right.[.]
If you do, I'll let you live.[.][A]
I hold your life in the palm of my
hand. Do not test my good humor.[A]
Now come over here, bend your[.]
knee, and beg for your life.[A]
Show me how Renais dogs grovel.[.][A][OpenRight]I think not.[A][OpenMidLeft]What?[.][A][OpenRight]You said your name was Valter, didn't you?[A]
Well, I'm sorry, Valter, but I don't have[.]
time to waste playing games with you.[.][A]
So, we're going to knock you louts about a
bit and then make our way out of here.[A][OpenMidLeft]Fool[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]Have you gone mad?[A]
Do you truly believe you can fight
your way past my wyvern knights?[A][OpenRight]Watch and see. I don't pick[.]
fights I can't win.[.][A][Clear]
Kyle, Forde.
Are you ready?[A][OpenFarRight]My life has been yours since the
moment I took my chivalric vows.[A][OpenFarRight][ClearFace][OpenFarRight][LoadFace][0x116][OpenFarRight][ToggleSmile]It's moments like these that
keep me by your side, my prince.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenFarRight][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft]What idiotic wretches you are[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
Prepare yourselves to be
destroyed utterly![A][OpenRight]We break to the east. GO![.][A]
[09E4]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x148][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x136][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]So, tell me[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
You have ascertained Eirika's[.]
whereabouts, have you not?[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]I have.[.][A]
I sent some of our men to follow
the princess as she fled Serafew.[.][A]
They tell me Eirika and her friends[.]
will be coming this way shortly.[A]
Our ambush is ready and waiting.
There's no way they can escape.[.][A]
Like rats in a sack, as they say.[.]
Heh heh heh[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Very good[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
[ToggleSmile]Won't that wretched Valter be delighted.[A][Clear]
Now about this Princess Eirika[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
I hear she's quite a handful.[.][A]
They say her paladin withstood
Valter's lance[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
Tell me, Novala, are you certain you
can handle this assignment?[.][A][OpenMidRight]Don't worry. Everything[.]
is under control.[.][A]
I've brought along a certain
something from Renais.[A]
It will negate whatever futile
resistance they offer. Ha ha ha[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Heh heh heh[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
[ToggleSmile]Pray it goes as you say.[A]
Very well. Do what you must.
I must return to the capital.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Will you not stay and see how[.]
Eirika looks in captivity?[A][OpenMidLeft]Unlike two other layabouts I know,
I do not have such time to waste.[.][A]
I have much to do for our master.[.]
A mountain of tasks awaits me.[A]
My time is far too precious to waste
on the likes of that royal whelp.[.][A]
Trifles such as these are best left in
the hands of servants[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]such as you.[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Y-yes, of course[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[ToggleSmile]Then[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]travel well.[A][CloseSpeechSlow][OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidRight]Hmph[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
Freakish old man.[.][A]
You should have watched. You might
have learned something.[.][A]
I will capture the princess, and I will[.]
replace you at our master's side.[.][A]
You will stew in regret, and I will[.]
enjoy every moment.[.][A]
[09E5]
[OpenLeft][LoadFace][0x102][OpenFarRight][LoadFace][0x136][OpenFarRight][ToggleSmile]Ha ha ha[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[ToggleSmile]Princess Eirika of Renais![A]
Accept your fate. You have
nowhere to flee![A][LoadOverworldFaces][OpenLeft]What?!
Who are you?[A]
And where[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]where did[.]
you come from?[A][OpenFarRight]You're as beautiful as I'd heard[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
And you're even wearing your bracelet.[A]
I suppose we should begin there. Would
you surrender your lovely little trinket?[.][A][OpenFarLeft][LoadFace][0x104][OpenFarLeft]Ah![.][A][OpenLeft]My bracelet[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
Why do you want it?[.][A][OpenFarRight]His Majesty desires it.[.]
That's reason enough.[.][A]
Once I present it to him, he will make
me a general, and I will be famous.[.][A]
Come, hand it over. Do it quickly,
and I'll leave you alive.[.][A][OpenFarLeft]Princess Eirika, you will do no such thing.[.][A][OpenLeft]Of course not.[A][OpenFarRight]Obedience will save you pain.[.][A]
You came all this way to aid
Prince Ephraim, have you not?[.][A]
A fool's errand. Ephraim fell before
the empire's might.[.][A]
As we speak he wastes away in a cell in[.]
Renvall, meekly awaiting his execution.[.][A][OpenLeft]My brother?![A]
You lie! A pitiful worm like you
could never defeat my brother![A][OpenFarRight]Bah. Protest all you like.
It does not change the truth.[.][A]
Ephraim has lost, and it was
Grado that defeated him![A][OpenLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenFarRight]You're not going to acquiesce,
are you? Very well.[.][A]
Bring me the child.[.][A]
[09E6]
[OpenLeft][LoadFace][0x102][OpenFarLeft][LoadFace][0x104][OpenRight][LoadFace][0x163][OpenFarRight][LoadFace][0x136][OpenRight]H-help me[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenLeft]Ah![.][A][OpenFarRight]Look familiar? She's a citizen
of your precious Renais.[A]
Now give me the bracelet![.]
Do it, or the child dies![.][A][OpenLeft]No, please[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
You win. But I must have your word
the child will suffer no harm.[A][OpenFarLeft]Princess, wait.[.]
That bracelet[.][ToggleMouthMove]--[ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenLeft]It's not worth a child's life.[A]
Forgive me, Seth.[.][A]
[09E7]
[OpenLeft][LoadFace][0x102][OpenFarLeft][LoadFace][0x104][OpenRight][LoadFace][0x163][OpenFarRight][LoadFace][0x136][OpenFarRight][ToggleSmile]Yes[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]there can be no mistaking it![.][A]
[ToggleSmile]Next, your weapons. Take them off[.]
and hand them over.[.][A][OpenFarLeft]No.[.][A]
Surrendering our weapons would be[.]
tantamount to suicide.[A]
You demand too much of us.[A][OpenFarRight]I see years of peace and idleness have not
dulled the wits of all Renais's knights.[A]
Well then, my hostage has no more use to
me, does she? Ah, such a waste.[.][A][Clear]
Wait a moment[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
I've just had a delicious idea.[.][A]
Have you heard of the giant spiders prowling
about this region?[A]
They'd appreciate a nice, hot meal, wouldn't
you agree?[A][OpenLeft]You can't[.][ToggleMouthMove]--[ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenRight]Nooo![.][A][OpenRight][ClearFace][OpenFarRight][ToggleSmile]Ha ha! This will be a delight to watch![.][A]
[ToggleSmile]These fools will curse the day they[.]
were born to Renais![A][OpenLeft]Why[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]why would you[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][Clear]
How can you do such a thing?[A][OpenFarRight]This is WAR! There are no rules here![.]
In war, you can do anything! Anything![A]
You curs of Renais have lost! Your
idiotic ravings mean nothing[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenLeft]Enough. Hold your tongue.[.][A][OpenFarRight]Wha[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]what?![A][OpenLeft]I[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
We, the people of Renais, have long honored[.]
our allegiance with the Grado Empire.[.][A]
And you invaded without warning. You
ravaged our land. You killed my father[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
Even then, I told myself I must not hate
Grado or her people.[A]
If I gave in to my hate, the bond between[.]
our lands would be lost forever.[A]
I refused to hate. Instead, I lived for the[.]
day our nations would know peace again.[.][A][Clear]
But[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
If this is Grado's true face[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
If you could extinguish Renais without [.]
pity, without remorse[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][Clear]
If this is the case, then there is no room
in my heart for forgiveness.[A][OpenFarRight]Impudent girl![A]
Do you expect your words to save
your countrymen? They will not.[.][A]
Your beloved people will all die,[.]
as will you.[A]

This is a trap.[.][A]
The whole area is covered in a

We cannot abandon those people while any

[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x104][OpenMidLeft]Your late father, King Fado[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
He ordered me to keep silent until
the proper time arrived.[A]
However, with all that has happened,
with Emperor Vigarde's actions[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
I feel it imperative that I tell
you everything, Princess Eirika.[A]
Are you ready to hear the secret
of the bracelet you wear?[.][A][OpenMidRight]I am[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]As you know, Princess[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
Renais houses one of the
legendary Sacred Stones.[A][OpenMidRight]Of course. It's in the temple. It's[.]
supposed to be a ward against evil.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Yes, the true stone is. But the stone[.]
in the temple is nothing but a forgery.[.][A]
The real Sacred Stone of Renais lies
beneath the royal castle.[.][A]
Guarding it is a powerful seal, an
infinitely complex lock of sorts.[.][A][OpenMidRight]What?[.][A]
Is this true?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Yes. King Fado confided in me himself.[A]
The Sacred Stones banished evil long ago
and possess powers beyond our ken.[A]
The ancient kings of Renais felt it[.]
prudent to seal ours away.[A]
They feared its power could be misused.[.]
They thought to remove the temptation.[A]
The keys to break the seal were hidden,[.]
too[.][ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]Forged into bracelets[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]The very ones that you and your[.]
brother, Prince Ephraim, wear.[A][OpenMidRight]Our bracelets?[A]
How could Father keep this a
secret from me for so long?[.][A][OpenMidLeft][OpenQuote]They must know nothing of the bracelets.[.]
Tell them only if some great peril strikes.[CloseQuote][A]
These were King Fado's exact orders.[A]
Prince Ephraim knows nothing of the[.]
bracelets' secret, either.[A]
The king told me this out of fear that
something might happen to him.[A]
So that, when the time came, the two of you[.]
would learn the truth.[A][OpenMidRight]The bracelets have such meaning[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]Yes. And we are the only living souls who[.]
know the secret of the Stone of Renais.[.][A]
At least, that's what I was given to
believe. And yet[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][LoadOverworldFaces][OpenMidRight]Yet the Grado army has made it clear
that they want me only for my bracelet.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Yes, quite clear at that[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
I don't know how, but Emperor Vigarde[.]
must have learned the secret somehow.[.][A]
And now, his troops pursue the bracelet, and
we are no closer to knowing his motives.[A][OpenMidRight]He would use the bracelets to unlock the
Sacred Stone and destroy it in secret[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]Perhaps.[A][OpenMidRight]Which means that my brother[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
and his bracelet[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]If he's been captured, they may have the
bracelet already, and he may be[.][ToggleMouthMove]--[ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]Ephraim[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]Princess, we must take Novala's words to
be true. We must hurry to Prince Ephraim.[.][A]
The enemy soldiers who fled the battle will[.]
have reported our location by now.[A]
If the prince is being held prisoner
at Renvall[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
I fear they might execute him once they[.]
learn of our approach.[A][OpenMidRight]You're right. We've no time to waste.[.][A]
We must hurry to Renvall![.]
Let's go rescue my brother![.][A]

[ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x15E][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0xFFFF][OpenMidLeft]I heard there are monstrous spiders[.]
living in the mountains to the east.[A]
They're said to be poisonous, so I
stocked up on antitoxins[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
This antitoxin's strong stuff. No need
to worry about poison with this around.[.][A]
Hey! Why don't you go ahead and take
one. Go on, you may need it.[A]
They might still eat you, but at least
they won't be able to poison you![.][A]

A heavy fog has rolled in.[A]

If you're here, my brother

Prince Ephraim and I were both captured by
Grado forces and held here as prisoners.[A]
I just managed to escape my cell[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]

It's what I had prayed for[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenLeft]Orson[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]are you well?[.][A]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x15F][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0xFFFF][OpenMidLeft]Prince Ephraim? Well, gracious me[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
I haven't heard anything about him.[.][A]
But now that you mention it, there
was a big commotion a few days back.[A]
I guess the soldiers were chasing[.]
somebody, but[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
Well, I was so tired, I fell asleep[.]
and missed the whole thing.[.][A]
[0A08]
[OpenRight][LoadFace][0x102][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x144][OpenMidLeft]This way, Princess Eirika.[A]
Prince Ephraim is being kept
in a cell back here.[A][OpenRight]Very well, let's go.[A][OpenFarRight][LoadFace][0x104][OpenFarRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]Sir Orson.[A]
How long ago were you[.]
taken prisoner?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Some two weeks past. Prince Ephraim[.]
and I were forced to surrender.[.][A]
We've been held captive here in this
dungeon since that black day.[.][A][OpenFarRight]Did you gain any news from your[.]
captors during that time?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Unfortunately, no. Not a word[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
Our daily meal was brought to us by[.]
servants from the neighboring village.[A]
They were instructed not to speak to
us, and we heard nothing of the war.[A]
Tell me, Seth.
How fares Renais?[.][A][OpenFarRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]Renais has fallen. King Fado[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
The king is dead.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Dead[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove] My king[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
My apologies, Princess Eirika.
I have served you poorly[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenRight]You're not to blame, Sir Orson.[.][A]
We must look to the future, not[.]
find fault in the past.[.][A]
The Grado army pursues me in [.]
hopes of acquiring my bracelet.[.][A]
My brother wears this bracelet's
twin, and he is in danger, too.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Bracelet?[.][A]
Ah, I remember[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]Prince Ephraim
still wears the bracelet.[.][A]
And Grado is after them?[A]
If that's the case, Princess[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
Perhaps you should entrust the
bracelets to someone else.[A][OpenRight]Perhaps, but[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]Give them to me or to Seth. Let[.]
someone you trust guard them.[.][A]
If the empire desires your bracelet, you
are in danger as long as you hold it.[.][A]
For your own safety, Your Highness,[.]
please. What say you?[.][A]
We must not allow the Sacred Stone
of Renais to be taken.[A][OpenRight]Everything you say is true
and sensible, yet[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][LoadOverworldFaces][OpenFarRight][ClearFace][OpenRight][ClearFace][OpenFarRight][LoadFace][0x102][OpenRight][LoadFace][0x104][OpenRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]Sir Orson.[A]
I am sorry for this, but
please give me your weapons.[A][OpenFarRight]Seth?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]What are you talking about, Seth?[.][A]
Can't you see I'm unarmed? Do you[.]
think they allow prisoners weapons?[.][A]
What kind of injury have you taken
that you suggest such foolishness?[A][OpenRight]If I am mistaken, then I will give
you all due apologies.[A]
However, there are questions I have[.]
that I cannot answer. Too many questions.[.][A][Clear]
Why did no enemy reinforcements come from[.]
the castle during our battle outside?[.][A]
Why would you escape your cell and yet
leave Prince Ephraim in chains?[.][A]
How do you know of the tie between the
bracelets and the Sacred Stone?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Seth, there is some misunderstanding
here. I[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenRight]And why[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
Why do you conceal a blade
within your doublet?[A][OpenFarRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]What?[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]Very well.[A]
You haven't changed a bit, Seth.[A]
If only Eirika had been alone. You,[.]
however, simply will not be deceived.[.][A][OpenFarRight]Orson! What is the[ToggleMouthMove]--[ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenRight]Orson. Why did you
betray Renais?[A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]My fondest wish will be granted[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
To spend the rest of my days in the[.]
embrace of my loving wife once more[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][ToggleSmile][OpenFarRight]What are you saying?[A]
[0A09]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x138][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x144][OpenMidLeft]That's enough. You've done
well, Orson.[A]
I'll take over now. You may[.]
return to your beloved wife.[A]

[OpenFarRight][LoadFace][0x102][OpenRight][LoadFace][0x104][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x138][OpenRight]Who are you?[A][OpenMidLeft]We've never met. I am Tirado.[.][A]
Loyal and talented aide to Valter,
general of the Grado army.[A][OpenRight]You're that monster's[.][ToggleMouthMove]--[ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]And you are General Seth of Renais, yes?[A]
I thought to catch a little bird in my net,[.]
and it seems instead I've snared a hawk.[A][OpenFarRight]Where is my brother?![.][A][OpenMidLeft]Ah, yes. Your brother. He's not here.[.][A]
The coward fled Lord Valter's pursuit[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
Somehow, he escaped the castle.[.][A][Clear]
And escaping under these conditions[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
Tch! Such stubbornness is quite annoying.[.][A][Clear]
It was my cunning that led us to turn this
unfortunate blunder to our advantage.[.][A]
I spread the rumors myself. I led the[.]
villagers to believe he was our prisoner.[.][A]
What better trap with which to catch
his sweet, devoted sister?[A][OpenFarRight]My brother escaped?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Yes, but your no-doubt emotional reunion
will have to wait until the afterlife.[A][Clear]
Let's end this, shall we?[.][A]
First, to destroy the bridge and cut off
your only avenue of escape[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x114][OpenMidLeft]Eirika![.][A][OpenFarRight][LoadFace][0x118][OpenFarRight]Prince Ephraim, I hear sounds from the
east corridor. Sounds like fighting.[A][OpenRight][LoadFace][0x116][OpenRight]Do you think it could be General
Seth and Princess Eirika?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]We have two goals here, men: save[.]
Eirika and vanquish the enemy.[A]
Kyle. Forde. Are you ready?[.][A][OpenFarRight]Yes, Your Highness.[.][A][OpenRight]As always.[A][OpenFarRight]Lord Ephraim, we should join forces[.]
with Princess Eirika first.[.][A]
We should be able to reach them[.]
by way of the eastern corridor.[.][A][OpenRight]Come now, Kyle.[.][A]
That seems like a lot of trouble when[.]
we could just crush Grado between us.[.][A][OpenFarRight][OpenQuote]A lot of trouble[CloseQuote]? Forde, you're as
insolent as you are careless![.][A]
If anything were to happen to Princess
Eirika, we Knights of Renais would[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenRight]Fine, fine. I see where you stand.
Calm down, before you boil over.[A]

[0A0E]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x138][OpenMidLeft]Hmm[.][ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]My men were unable to[.]
finish the job, were they?[A]

However[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
I expect you'll wish you'd

And you as well, General?[.][A][OpenRight]Not at all. We're happy you're safe.[A]
But tell me, Prince, do you know of Orson's[.]
treachery against you and all of Renais?[A][OpenLeft]Yes, though I learned of it all too late,[.]
after we'd been trapped at Renvall.[.][A]
I still find it difficult to believe that[.]
after all his years of service to Renais[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
I am morally responsible for his plight.[A][OpenFarRight]Ephraim[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenFarFarLeft][MoveFarLeft][OpenFarLeft][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]Ephraim.[A][OpenLeft]What is it, Myrrh?[A][OpenFarLeft]Something's coming[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove] It's drawing near.[.][A]
Dark[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]big[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]and great in number.[A][OpenLeft]I understand. It looks like[.]
we should get out of here.[A][OpenFarRight]Um, Brother?

Her hair is indigo[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
Where did[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenLeft]Ah, that's a long story.
For now, we must move.[A]
Suffice to say Emperor Vigarde has
enlisted some[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]otherworldly powers.[A][Clear]
We must warn everyone of the danger.[A]
[0A11]

You're alive! You're alive![.][A][OpenMidLeft]Well, of course I am.[.][A]
After we escaped Renvall, I thought I'd[.]
strike a blow against the emperor himself.[A]
When I heard that you'd been waylaid by the[.]
enemy, however, I turned back to find you.[A]
Looks like my timing was impeccable.[A][OpenMidRight]I'm so sorry. The irony is that[.]
I was trying to rescue you.[.][A]
All I did was interfere with
your plans[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]What are you talking about?[.]

Your efforts alone are enough[.]
to inspire me.[A]

You're safe![A][OpenMidRight]Princess Eirika is safe as well.[A]
I'm afraid I have much news to
relate to you.[A]
That will have to wait, though. For[.]
now, we must cut our way out of here.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Yes. Let's conclude our business here[.]

About Orson[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]We heard it all.[A]
Unbelievable, isn't it?[.]
But facts are facts.[A][OpenMidLeft]Yes. If Orson can turn his

We'd heard you were captured

little brother.[.][A]
Death will have a tough time catching[.]
anyone who rides with our prince![.][A]
But it's not like we've avoided[.]
trouble altogether, that's for sure.[A]
Hm? Say, have you grown taller on me?[.][A][OpenMidRight]I have. I've also finished my training.[.]
I'm now a sworn Knight of Renais.[.][A]

let you go into danger without me.[A][OpenMidRight]Does King Hayden know of this?[A][OpenMidLeft]No. He'd just say, [OpenQuote]I forbid you to go
on this foolish errand,[CloseQuote] like always.[.][A]
But I'm so worried about you.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Thank you, Tana.[A]
I appreciate your concern,
but King Hayden would[.][ToggleMouthMove]--[ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]You and Ephraim, my father and
my brother[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
You're all fighting together,[.]
fighting for a noble cause.[.][A]
I cannot be left out.[.]
I will not be left out.[.][A]
Please, Eirika.[.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]Oh[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
All right.
I never could refuse you anything.[A]
Come on. Let's go, Tana.[A][OpenMidLeft]Thank you, Eirika![A]
[0A1A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x102][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x104][OpenMidRight]Your Highness, we've reached Port Kiris.[A]
If we can find passage across the North[.]
Sea, we will reach Rausten in 10 days.[A][OpenMidLeft]It smells of the tides[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
This is a busy place, isn't it?[.][A][OpenMidRight]It's a trade center. Peoples of all[.]
nations pass through here.[A]
Do not become so enthralled with the sights[.]
and sounds that you forget your mission.[A][OpenMidLeft]I won't.[A]
I'm a mercenary by the name of Erina.[.][A]
I'm traveling to Rausten to[.]
receive a commission.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Let us look for a ship then, Erina.[.]
The docks are this way.[.][A][OpenMidLeft][MoveLeft][LoadOverworldFaces][OpenLeft]Hm?[.][A][OpenMidRight]Is something amiss?[.][A][OpenLeft]Seth, that woman over there?
Is that[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[0A1B]
[ToggleSmile][OpenRight][LoadFace][0x122][OpenFarRight][LoadFace][0x123][OpenRight]Oh, these dainty sugar pastries!
They're delightfully scrumptious![.][A]
Flavorful without being overwhelming,[.]
refined without being banal[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenFarRight]Gwah ha ha![.]
Right you are, Lady L'Arachel![A][OpenFarFarLeft][LoadFace][0x102][OpenFarFarLeft][MoveFarLeft][OpenFarLeft]You look familiar[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenRight]Oh![.]
Aren't you[ToggleMouthMove]--[ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenFarLeft]We've met before, haven't we?[.][A]
You arrived with your companions
when we encountered those creatures[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
Your name is L'Arachel, is it not?[A][OpenRight]A wonder and pleasure that we should meet[.]
again so soon! It is providence![A][OpenFarRight][ClearFace][OpenFarRight][LoadFace][0x124][OpenFarRight]Bad luck is the only thing the
divine has ever provided you![.][A][OpenRight]Oh, and if you have not yet tried[.]
one, these pastries are also divine.[A]
Would you care for one?[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenFarLeft]Uh, thank you[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
No, wait[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]That's not why[ToggleMouthMove]--[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]We're actually on our way to the
Theocracy of Rausten.[.][A]
We're rather in a rush and need to
find passage on a ship[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenRight]Oh, dear. I'm afraid you'll find none to
assist you. No ships are leaving port.[A][OpenFarLeft]Pardon?[.][A][OpenRight]You see, I find myself heading home once
more to my beloved Rausten as well![.][A]
And actually, I'm quite well known with[.]
the powers-that-be here in Port Kiris.[A]
So I ordered them to ready the finest[.]
passenger vessel for me.[A][Clear]
But both merchants and passenger ships
alike are too frightened to set sail.[.][A]
It seems a giant ghost ship has been
sinking every ship it finds[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
Would that I could confront it, I could[.]
stop its foul villainy in a moment.[.][A]
Alas. It's such a shame.[A][OpenFarLeft]Yes, yes[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]Uh[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
That is troublesome. Still,[.]
I must get to Rausten somehow.[A][OpenRight]You needn't worry too much.[.][A]
After all, if the sea is closed to
you, simply follow the overland route![A][OpenFarLeft]The overland route?[.][A]
I've heard that's a terribly
roundabout path to travel.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenRight]Oh, it is, but don't you see? The hardships[.]
of the road, they are truly blessings![A]
They will toughen you and strengthen your[.]
resolve when you need to face great evil.[.][A]
For example, I have been tasked with a
great trial in order to better me.[A]
I understand my path, O unknowable
forces of providence![.][A]
I, your faithful servant L'Arachel, shall[.]
overcome! With faith and divine strength![.][A][OpenFarRight]Now, listen, L'Arachel! You might be
thrilled about going the long way, but[ToggleMouthMove]--[ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenRight]Come now, we're leaving.
Dozla? Rennac?[A]
Don't fall behind![A][OpenRight][ClearFace][OpenRight][LoadFace][0x123][OpenRight]Gwah ha ha! Wait for us,
Lady L'Arachel![.][A]
Come on, Rennac!
We run 'til we drop![A]
The first one to collapse from
exhaustion is the winner![.][A][OpenRight][ClearFace][ToggleSmile][OpenFarRight]Help[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
Why is this happening to me?[A][OpenFarRight][ClearFace]
[0A1C]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x104][OpenFarRight][LoadFace][0x102][OpenFarRight][MoveMidRight][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]Uh, Seth?[.][A]
Isn't Rausten in the other direction?[.]
Aren't they heading toward Frelia?[A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]It's nothing you need[.]
concern yourself with, milady.[A][CloseSpeechSlow][OpenMidLeft]Our only concern now is to decide[.]
our next course of action.[A]
An overland journey would be very long.[.][A]
However, it seems that may be our only
choice at the moment[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]I agree.
Whatever shall we do[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[0A1D]
[OpenFarRight][LoadFace][0x102][OpenRight][LoadFace][0x104][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x139][OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]You're Eirika, the
princess of Renais, ain't ya?[.][A][OpenFarRight]What?[.][A][OpenRight]Dastard! Away with you![.][A][OpenMidLeft]No need to get personal![A]
You know, there's a pretty
price on your pretty head.[A]
Sorry, but I need that gold.[A]
[0A1E]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x119][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x16B][OpenMidLeft]Attention![A]
Carcino's mercenaries will arrest the[.]
princess of Renais shortly.[.][A]
Our duty here is nearly ended, and
I expect no further hostilities.[A]
If you must fight, however, remember
that the whole empire fights with you![A][OpenMidRight]Um, Commander?[A]
What should I do?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Who are you?[A][OpenMidRight]Sir! I'm Amelia of Silva, sir![A]
I'm new. I was only assigned to your command
today. I wanted to fight for the empire![A][OpenMidLeft]I don't need your life story, fool! Recruits
are in front! Grab a lance and move![A][OpenMidRight]Sir, yes sir![.][A][Clear]
This lance[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]Stab the enemy.[.][A]
I'm not afraid[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
I'm a citizen of Grado.[.]
It's my duty to fight.[A]
And I'll fight my best![.][A]
[0A1F]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x119][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x16B][OpenMidLeft]Hrm[.][ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]This battle isn't going[.]
well at all.[A]
Stinking mercenaries! All a[.]
bunch of worthless slugs.[.][A]
I could smash the whole lot of
'em if I had the time, but[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
I've got to follow orders. That's[.]
the lot of a soldier, ain't it?[.][A]
Let's move out, troops! We're[.]
returning to the capital![.][A][OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidRight]What?[.][A]
Are we really supposed to leave[.]
with the enemy right there?[.][A]
Well[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]at least that means[.]
the fighting is finally over.[.][A]
[0A20]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x139][OpenMidLeft]Blast! This ain't right!
These guys are too tough[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
5,000 gold ain't nearly enough
for this![.][A]
[0A21]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x139][OpenMidLeft]Th-that stinkin' Pablo[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
He[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]lied to me[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[0A22]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x104][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102][OpenMidLeft]Your Highness, are you well?[A][OpenMidRight]Yes, I believe so[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][CloseSpeechSlow][OpenMidRight]Who are these men?[A]
They don't appear to be[.]
Grado Imperial troops.[A][OpenMidLeft]Judging by their crude swordplay,[.]
I'd say they're mercenaries.[A]
We can expect more of them
in the area, too, I think.[A]
Wait here.[A]
[0A23]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x104][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x16D][OpenMidRight]W-wait! I give up![A]
I don't want to fight anymore!
We were just doing a job.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Who hired you?[A][OpenMidRight]I may be nothing but a hired blade, but[.]
I have my honor. I won't say a word.[A][OpenMidLeft][MoveLeft][OpenLeft]I admire your professionalism.
I guess we have no use for you.[.][A][OpenMidRight][MoveFarRight][OpenFarRight]No, wait! I'll talk!
Carcino![A]
It was Pablo of the Carcino[.]
Council of Elders![A][OpenLeft]Councilman Pablo?[.][A][SendToBack][OpenFarLeft][LoadFace][0x102][OpenFarLeft]That doesn't make sense![A]
Carcino and Frelia are allies.
Why would they target me?[.][A][OpenFarRight]I don't know[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
Could be they've decided Grado's going to[.]
win. They want to be on the winning side.[.][A]
Some of the others opposed Pablo, but[.]
I heard he had 'em all silenced but quick.[A]
That's all I know, I swear it.[A][OpenLeft]I believe you. Go.[A]
[0A24]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x102][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x104][OpenMidRight]We were careless. We should have seen[.]
this coming.[A]
Carcino's a young and ambitious nation
ruled by power-hungry merchants.[A]
And Grado grows more powerful with
every passing day.[A]
So it's no surprise Carcino's merchant
lords would throw in with Grado now.[A][OpenMidLeft]Wait![.]
Prince Innes[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
Prince Innes was to pass through
Carcino on his way to Jehanna[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
If Carcino has betrayed us, then he[.]
ran headlong into enemy territory[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[0A25]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102][OpenFarFarLeft][LoadFace][0x169][OpenFarFarLeft][MoveMidLeft][OpenMidLeft]Princess Eirika![A]
I bring dire tidings![.][A][OpenMidRight]I know you[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]You were a messenger
riding with Prince Innes.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Yes, and I have news of him.
Prince Innes is in danger![A]
Carcino's merchant army struck and
cut through half our men.[.][A]
The prince is trapped in a siege.[.]
He has no means of escape, and[ToggleMouthMove]--[ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]No more![A]
I understand. Return to Frelia
and deliver your message![.][A][OpenMidLeft]What of Prince Innes?[.][A][OpenMidRight]Leave him to us. The prince's[.]
troubles should burden you no more.[.][A]
We will see him to safety.[A]
[0A26]
[OpenFarFarLeft][LoadFace][0x124][OpenFarRight][LoadFace][0x104][OpenRight][LoadFace][0x102][OpenFarFarLeft][MoveFarLeft][OpenFarLeft][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]Hey, you.[.][A]
Have Lady L'Arachel and her man,
Sir Stubble-chin, gone yet?[.][A][OpenRight]Aren't you[ToggleMouthMove]--[ToggleMouthMove][A]
Yes, they no longer appear
to be in the city.[A][OpenFarLeft]Whew[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]I'm finally free! No more getting[.]
bossed around by that witless ninny![A]
Thanks. I owe you one.
Take this.[A]
Now that I'm free again. I think I'm
just gonna wander about for a while.[A][OpenFarLeft][ClearFace][OpenRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]What a strange relationship they have.[A][OpenFarRight]Lady Eirika, I think we[.]
ought to be leaving soon.[.][A][SendToBack][OpenRight]Yes. We must hurry
to Prince Innes's side![.][A]
[0A27]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x106][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x119][OpenMidLeft]Oh, who are you?[A][OpenMidRight]What? What?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Are you one of the locals? This is
a dangerous spot. You should hide.[A]
Here, come with me.[.][A][OpenMidRight]But[.][ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]But I'm[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]I'm Franz, a Knight of Renais.[A]
What's your name?[.]
What are you doing here?[A][OpenMidRight]I-I'm Amelia.[.][A]
I'm[.][ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]Actually, I'm a Grado soldier.
I'm supposed to be fighting you.[A][OpenMidLeft]Really?[.][A]
So, uh, you're my enemy?[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]I guess[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
Are you[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
Are you going to make[.]
me your prisoner?![A][OpenMidLeft]No! No, I wouldn't do that.[.][A]
But[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]this is a problem.[A][OpenMidRight]What should we do?[A][OpenMidLeft]First of all, you must listen to
me and do as I say.[.][A]
We'll talk to Princess Eirika later.[A][OpenMidRight]What? NO![.][A]
My commander told me Eirika's a[.]
cruel and merciless fiend who[.][ToggleMouthMove]--[ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]Oh, that's utter nonsense.[A]
I've never heard the princess[.]
utter an unkind word to anyone.[.][A]
I understand why you're frightened.[.]
You think we're the enemy.[A]
But if you'd only trust me[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
Will you come with me?[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]Mm[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
Well, all right.
I'll trust you, Franz.[A]
[0A28]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x102][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x119][OpenMidLeft]Who are you?[A][OpenMidRight]What? What?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Are you from around here?[.][A]
You should find someplace to hide.
These men are after me. It's not safe.[A][OpenMidRight]But[.][ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]But I'm[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]Yes?[A][OpenMidRight]I'm a Grado soldier. I'm here to
stop the princess of Renais[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]Huh?[A]
You're with Grado?[A][OpenMidRight]And you're Princess Eirika?[.][A]
But the commander said Eirika's[.]
a cruel and merciless fiend[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]What? No, I'm[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]I don't know what Grado's[.]
officers have been telling you, but[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
Our two countries are at war, so I
suppose they can say what they want.[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]Mistress Eirika[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
I, uh, I surrender.[.]
I won't fight you.[A][OpenMidLeft]Huh?[A][OpenMidRight]I became a soldier because I admired
General Duessel's sense of honor.[.][A]
But the general has been very opposed[.]
to this war from the beginning[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
And now I see you, and you look so
sad about all of this.[A]
I don't know what's right anymore.[A][Clear]
I'm just a soldier, but I want to[.]
decide for myself.[A]
I want to understand the truth
myself, to see it with my own eyes.[.][A] [.][OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]I see.[A]
So[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]does this mean you're coming with us?[.]
I suppose I should ask your name then.[A][OpenMidRight]Amelia. Amelia of Silva.[A]
[0A29]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x124][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0xFFFF][OpenMidLeft]My, oh, my[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]It's about time they left.[A]
I'm finally done getting ordered about
without getting paid.[.][A]
Huh? Oh, don't mind me. Just talking
to myself.[A]
Here, I want you to hold on to this[.]
for me. Don't tell anyone.[A]
Oh, and don't say a word about seeing me
to Lady L'Arachel, all right? Deal?[.][A]
[0A2A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x15C][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0xFFFF][OpenMidLeft]Wh-what do you want?
Gimme a break[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
Leave us out of this stupid war of yours![.]
We don't want anything to do with it![.][A][Clear]
Or[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]are you just another victim, like[.]
the rest of us here?[A]
Well, regardless[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]Here.[.][A]
Take this, and go do something about
all this fighting, will you?[A]
[0A2B]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x140][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x14B][OpenMidLeft]General Glen of the Grado Imperial Army,
also known as the Sunstone[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]Yes[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]Your orders.[A]
Capture the leader of the rebel[.]
army in Carcino. Capture Eirika.[A][OpenMidRight]Eirika[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
Do you mean the princess of Renais?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Eirika invaded Carcino.[.][A]
She massacred the citizens
of Port Kiris.[A]
Then, she fled south.[.][A]
Glen. Go. Crush the rebels
who brought ruin to Carcino.[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]Understood, sire.[.][A]
[0A2C]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x14B][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x113][OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]What did the emperor say, Brother?[A][OpenMidLeft]I've been ordered to kill the[.]
princess of Renais.[.][A]
Cormag, I want you to remain here[.]
in the capital. I'll go alone.[A][OpenMidRight]If that's what you want, Brother, so
be it. But you seem troubled[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
Don't tell me you're concerned about
fighting the princess of a ruined land![.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]Hm[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]I never was able to slip
anything past you, little brother.[A]
You're right. This duty falls heavily[.]
on my shoulders, more than any other.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Tell me, Brother, do you know[.]
this princess?[A][OpenMidLeft]Yes. When Renais and Grado were[.]
still close[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
I met the girl[ToggleMouthMove]--[ToggleMouthMove]
I met Eirika only once.[.][A]
We spoke briefly, but I felt she
was a woman of great kindness.[A]
I cannot bring myself to believe
Princess Eirika is evil. I cannot.[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]Glen.[.][A]
The emperor has ordered[.][ToggleMouthMove]--[ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]There's the rub, Cormag.
That's it exactly.[A]
His Majesty has never spoken a falsehood
in all the time I've served him.[A]
And as a servant of the empire, I am
duty bound to obey his orders.[A]
But I can see no reason to think Princess[.]
Eirika's heart is any less gentle now.[A]
[0A2D]
[OpenLeft][LoadFace][0x14B][OpenFarLeft][LoadFace][0x113][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x142][SendToBack][OpenMidRight]What are these cowardly mutterings?[.][A]
It is because you three generals are
weak that we others must work so hard.[A]
And yet you get the honor of killing the
girl. How I long to do your duty for you![.][A][OpenLeft]Rrrr![.][A]
Valter, you treacherous swine[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]What's this? Is this how you speak
toward your peer knights of the realm?[A]
Lest you've forgotten, I, too, am a[.]
general[.][ToggleMouthMove]--[ToggleMouthMove]the same rank as you.[.][A][OpenLeft]You wretch. You were cast out from the
army for mistreating civilians.[.][A]
What lies have you told to receive pardon[.]
and reinstatement at the same time?[.][A][OpenMidRight]Our beloved emperor felt my skills
were needed, and his word is law.[.][A]
His Majesty has earned my sincerest[.]
and most undying gratitude.[.][A]
And then we have you three.[.]
Duessel, Selena, and you[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
The three of you have proven to be
unreliable time and time again.[.][A]
We were brought in to plug the holes,[.]
don't you see?[A]
You ought to thank me, Glen![A][OpenFarLeft]Valter! If you dare insult
my brother further[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]Come now, Cormag. And what would
you do to me if I did?[A]
Would you fight me? Here? Would you[.]
show such disloyalty to the emperor?[A][OpenFarLeft][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenLeft]Peace, Cormag.[A]
We are His Majesty's men.[.]
We will honor his commands.[.][A]
Mark my words, Valter: your crimes
are neither forgotten nor forgiven.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Hmph[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[0A2E]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x10F][OpenRight][LoadFace][0x11B][OpenFarRight][LoadFace][0x11C][SendToBack][OpenRight]Prince Innes. What do you[.]
say? Can you continue?[A][OpenMidLeft]Yes, of course. Do you believe this[.]
is enough to make me give up?[.][A]
I am surprised you mercenaries
haven't turned and fled, though.[A][OpenRight]Naw. You see, Gerik's Mercenaries takes its[.]
name from me, Gerik. I'm the chief here.[A]
If I quit while our employer still fought[.]
on, they'd want a new name, you follow me?[A]
So[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
What's the plan?[A][OpenMidLeft]Same as before. We remain surrounded.[.][A]
They're not going to allow us simply
to walk out of here[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][Clear]
I sent a messenger off with news of[.]
our plight.[.][A]
However, even on the wings of a pegasus[.]
knight, Frelia is days away.[A]
We can expect no help from them.[A][OpenRight]So we tighten our belts and survive,
is that it?[.][A]
Or would you rather quit this place[.]
and rest in comfort?[A][OpenMidLeft]Surrender?[A]
I'm the prince of Frelia. I don't know the
meaning of the word.[A]
The fate of the world rides on my shoulders,
and I'll make it to Jehanna.[A]
Even if I have to crawl there to do it.[.][A][OpenRight][ToggleSmile]Now, that makes me feel better.[.][A]
If you're so determined, we may all[.]
live a little while longer[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][ToggleSmile][OpenFarRight]Hey, Chief, Prince.[.][A][OpenRight]What is it, Tethys?[.][A][OpenFarRight]I've got bad news[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]and[.]
then I've got worse news.[.][A][OpenRight]What's the bad news?[A][OpenFarRight]We've no more weapons in reserve. What
you're holding is what we've got.[.][A]
Once those are gone, there won't be[.]
much fight left in us.[A][OpenRight]That is bad news[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
Well? What's the worse news?[A][OpenFarRight]They've begun to move.
They're going to attack again.[A]
Looks like they're sending up[.]
the whole lot of 'em this time.[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
Right. You two, you're done here.[.]
Discharged. Fired. Whatever.[A]
You can surrender or flee.
The choice is yours.[A][OpenRight]What?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]I'm the one they're after.[A]
Throw down your weapons, and
you'll walk away alive.[.][A]
I don't need you here. You'll[.]
only be in my way.[A]
Who knows? You filthy sellswords'll[.]
probably sell me out anyway.[A][OpenFarRight]Hold on there! That's not[.]
true, and you know it![A][OpenRight]Peace, Tethys.[A]
Hey, Prince. What[.]
are you going to do?[A][OpenMidLeft]I'm going to get out of here
on my own.[A]
I'll break to the south and[.]
escape into the mountains.[A][OpenRight]That ain't gonna be easy.[.]
How you plan on doing that?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]I'm not telling you. I've no idea[.]
when you'll decide to betray me.[A]
Go on. Get out of here.[.]
I'd rather do this alone.[.][A][OpenRight]Sounds like you're trying to make[.]
sure you're the only one who dies.[A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
Fool. I've no intention of dying.[.][A]
But there can be no false hope of[.]
reinforcements riding in to save the day.[.][A]
You and I are not the same. You're a
commoner, and I'm Frelia's heir.[A]
We of noble birth do not shirk the
duties to which we are born.[A][OpenRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]What are you waiting for? You may go.[.][A][OpenRight]Well played, milord.[A]
I've always loved the[.]
melodrama of martyrdom[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
There's no way I can abandon you
after that fine performance.[A][Clear]
I'm staying with you.[.]
To the end.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]To the[ToggleMouthMove]--[ToggleMouthMove]
What are you saying?[A]
You dare ignore the orders of the[.]
one who's paying your wages?![.][A][OpenRight]Tethys, I want you to[.]
go and surrender.[.][A]
Give my regards to Ewan[.]
and Marisa.[.][A][OpenFarRight]Don't be ridiculous.
I'm not going anywhere.[.][A]
Now would the two of you kindly[.]
stop acting like such[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]men?[A]
And you! You've already fired us.[.]
You can't order us to leave now.[A][OpenMidLeft]Unbelievable[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
And you people call[.]
yourselves mercenaries?[.][A]
I thought you fought for
money, not for duty.[A][OpenRight]Yeah, that's one of the rules.
Guess we're lousy mercenaries, eh?[A]
Now let's get thinking. We still need[.]
a plan to get us all out of here alive.[.][A]
You're supposed to be a good tactician,[.]
so I figure I won't die easily.[.][A]
Tell us what to do, Prince.[.]
We'll follow your orders.[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove]
Hm. Very well.[A]
I'll see what I can do to avoid[.]
getting us filled with arrows.[A][OpenFarRight]Ah[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
Say, Prince.[A]
If, by some miracle, aid were to come,
from what direction would it arrive?[A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]From the north. But there's[.]
little or no hope of that.[A]
Even if Frelia were to send us aid,[.]
they would not arrive until[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenFarRight]This may be good news[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
Then again, it may be more bad news.[A][Clear]
There. On that northern mountain path[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
Someone's coming.[.][A]
[0A2F]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x102][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x104][OpenMidLeft]Prince Innes![.][A][OpenMidRight]Princess Eirika, the prince is surrounded[.]
by the mercenary armies of Carcino.[.][A]
He looks vastly outnumbered. I doubt
he can hold out much longer.[A][OpenMidLeft]I can see that. Let's hurry![A]
[0A30]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x13A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Heh heh[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[ToggleSmile]My plan to get rid of Klimt has[.]
yielded some unexpected fruit.[A]
The head of Frelia's Prince Innes[.]
will make a fine gift to Grado.[.][A][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x16B][OpenMidRight]Lord Pablo, Prince Innes and his men have[.]
taken refuge in a mountain stronghold.[A]
Do we have your permission to finish
them off?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Yes. Flush the prince out[.]
and cut him down.[.][A]
We'll find Klimt later and roast
his old bones as well.[A]
[ToggleSmile]Heh heh heh[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][ToggleSmile]
[0A31]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x154][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x15C][OpenMidRight]Lord Klimt, Pablo's troops are moving[.]
toward the stronghold.[A]
It looks like they're planning on chasing[.]
down Prince Innes and his men.[A][OpenMidLeft]Pablo, you mad, reckless imbecile[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][Clear]
If Prince Innes dies here, the bond between[.]
Carcino and Frelia is sundered forever.[.][A]
Carcino will be nothing more than a[.]
vassal paying tribute to Grado[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
We must find some way to aid Prince[.]
Innes.[A][OpenMidRight]Wait, my lord Klimt![A]
Pablo is after you as well.[.]
If you reveal yourself here[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]Ahh[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
May fortune keep you safe,
Prince Innes[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[0A32]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x11E][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x16B][OpenMidRight]Hey! You're up![.][A]
You're getting paid a lot more
than us common soldiers.[A]
Time you earned your gold![A][OpenMidLeft]I hear you.[.][A]
Where do I start killing?[.][A][OpenMidRight]Th-that way! The Frelian troops![A]
Don't point that blade in our direction![A][OpenMidLeft]I'll do what I can. No promises.[A]
Good day.[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidRight]Whew[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]So that's Marisa, the Crimson[.]
Flash of Gerik's Mercenaries[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
She's a beauty, but I'll keep my
distance[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]and keep my head.[.][A]
[0A33]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x13A][OpenMidLeft]Yahh[ToggleMouthMove]...!?[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
You! You're[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
Prince Innes![.][A][OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x10F][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]You're one of Carcino's[.]
councilmen.[.][A]
Trying to trap me is a mistake.[.]
Failing, an expensive one.[A]
I think it's time for you to
learn how expensive.[A][OpenMidRight][ClearFace]
[0A34]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x13A][OpenMidLeft]No one can withstand the
might of Grado[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
Logic dictates we join now
or be subjugated later.[.][A]
I made the rational decision.[.]
The only decision![A][OpenMidLeft][ClearFace]
[0A35]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x13A][OpenMidLeft]Urrgh[.][ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]N-no.[.][A]
I cannot die when there is
such wealth to be had[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
Re-retreat![.]
Mercenaries, to me![.][A][OpenMidLeft][ClearFace]
[0A36]
[OpenLeft][LoadFace][0x142][OpenFarFarLeft][LoadFace][0x16B][OpenLeft][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]I've found you, Eirika.[.][A]
Seems you're as skilled as reports say.[.]
This is going to be fun.[A]
Yes, yes, yes.
I do so love strong women.[A][OpenFarFarLeft][MoveFarLeft][SendToBack][OpenFarLeft]Shall we attack, General Valter?[A][OpenLeft]No, we'll pass on dessert for now.[A]
Allow them to escape.[.]
We're leaving.[A]
[0A37]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x10F][OpenMidRight]Prince Innes, are you well?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Eirika[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]I'm sorry[.]
for troubling you.[A][OpenMidRight]No, it was no trouble.[A][OpenFarFarRight][LoadFace][0x154][OpenFarFarRight]Oh, Prince Innes! Thank[.]
goodness, you're unharmed![A][OpenMidRight][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][MoveLeft][OpenFarLeft][LoadFace][0x102][OpenFarFarRight][MoveFarRight][OpenFarLeft]Who are you?[A][OpenFarRight]Oh, where are my manners?[.][A]
I am a member of Carcino's Council
of Elders. My name is Klimt.[A][OpenFarLeft]A council member?[.][A][OpenLeft]So you're one of the traitors[.]
who ordered[.][ToggleMouthMove]--[ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenFarRight][MoveFarRight][OpenFarRight]P-peace, please![A]
I have no intention of opposing[.]
you or quarreling with you.[.][A]
I, too, have been marked for
death by Pablo[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenFarLeft]What is this all about?[.][A][SendToBack][OpenFarRight][MoveMidRight][OpenMidRight]It's a shameful tale[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
Carcino is a nation divided.[A]
As you know, Carcino has no king but is[.]
ruled by a council.[.][A]
But now the council has broken apart
into factions mired in discord[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenFarLeft]Factions[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
You're saying that the whole of[.]
Carcino has not betrayed Frelia?[A][OpenMidRight]Correct. The moderate factions prefer to
preserve our alliance with Frelia.[A]
Pablo's faction wishes to endear us to
Grado, to surrender us to their armies.[.][A][Clear]
Once Pablo realized he couldn't ply us with[.]
bribes, he began to have us assassinated.[.][A]
Those of us who remain have taken refuge
underground. We oppose him where we can.[A]
If you hadn't shown up, I'm not certain[.]
I would still be breathing[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenLeft]I do recall enemy troops combing this area
when I arrived[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
They were searching for you, is that it?[A][OpenMidRight]Pablo has usurped rule of the council.
We had no choice but to hide.[.][A]
Not all of Carcino's council has gone[.]
over to Grado's side, though[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
You must believe me[.][ToggleMouthMove]--[ToggleMouthMove]the whole of
Carcino does not believe as Pablo does.[.][A][OpenLeft][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]I see.[A][OpenFarLeft]Lord Klimt[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]I understand the
hardships you've endured.[.][A]
I am pleased to hear all of[.]
Carcino is not our foe.[.][A][OpenMidRight]I will depart at once for Frelia to[.]
explain our circumstance to the king.[.][A]
I think it is best if you return to[.]
Frelia as well.[.][A]
Pablo has considerable wealth, and he[.]
commands a vast mercenary force.[A]
I'm sure he'll send more of them this[.]
way as soon as he is able.[A]

[OpenRight][LoadFace][0x10F][OpenFarRight][LoadFace][0x102][OpenFarLeft][LoadFace][0x11C][OpenLeft][LoadFace][0x11B][SendToBack][OpenLeft]Prince Innes.[.][A]
Tethys and I are staying with[.]
you. Is that gonna work?[A][OpenRight]Yes, I would appreciate the help.[.][A]
Starting now, you've got a new contract,
though[ToggleMouthMove]--[ToggleMouthMove]the pay's double.[.][A]
If the two of you hadn't stayed with me[.]
back there, I would not have survived.[A]
Gerik, Tethys[.][ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]Thank you.
You have my gratitude.[A][OpenFarLeft]Tell me something, Prince.[A]
Did you get[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]er[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]hit on the head[.]
during that last skirmish?[A][OpenRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]That's unkind. My neck is not so
stiff that I cannot show gratitude.[.][A]
I would ask for your continued support
in the days ahead.[A][OpenFarRight]We both ask for your help.[A][OpenLeft][ToggleSmile]We've got a deal. Let's[.]
keep each other alive.[A][ToggleSmile]
[0A39]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x121][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x11C][OpenMidLeft]Ah! There you are, Sister.[A][OpenMidRight]Ewan![.][A]
How is it[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
What are you doing here?[A]
I told you to wait in the inn[.]
and behave yourself, didn't I?[A][OpenMidLeft]Yeah, but you always run off
and disappear.[A]
It's not fair. I want to have[.]
adventures, too.[A][OpenMidRight]You are such an imp[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
I am not out here running about[.]
having fun, you know?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]I know.[.][A]
That's why I came to see you.[.][A][Clear]
I can help.[.][A]
My teacher finally got around[.]
to teaching me some magic.[A]
Check this out.[.][A][OpenMidRight]H-hey! Knock it off.[A]
You shouldn't be using
magic here![.][A][OpenMidLeft]Well, I just thought maybe
I could help you work is all.[.][A]
I can protect you now, Sis.[.][A]
Come on, take me with you. I don't
wanna stay in that inn anymore.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]Oh[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]all right.[A]
I'll go and speak to the Chief
and Princess Eirika.[A]
Don't wander off while I'm gone.[A][OpenMidLeft]Yahoo![A]
[0A3A]
[OpenLeft][LoadFace][0x102][OpenFarLeft][LoadFace][0x10F][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x104][SendToBack][OpenMidRight]Princess Eirika, Prince Innes.[A]
I think we should follow the advice[.]
we've been given and return to Frelia.[A]
Continuing on through Carcino like this[.]
is too great a risk to your safety.[.][A][OpenFarLeft]The peril is self-evident.[A]
However, I have to reach Jehanna, and[.]
the only way is through Carcino.[A]
If I don't hurry, nations will fall, one
after another, to Grado's hunger.[.][A][OpenLeft]Innes is right.[.][A]
And the road to Rausten leads me
through both Carcino and Jehanna.[.][A]
However, pressing on will only
invite more mercenary attacks.[A][OpenMidRight][ClearFace][OpenRight][LoadFace][0x121][OpenRight]Hey, I've got an answer.[A]
I know a way that leads over the
mountains straight to Jehanna![A]
Want me to guide you?[.][A][OpenLeft][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]And who might you be?[.][A][OpenFarRight][LoadFace][0x11C][OpenFarRight]Ewan! Shush![A]
You know better than to interrupt[.]
people when they're talking.[A]
I'm so sorry. Please let me take
my brother out of the way.[A]
Come on, Ewan. Let's go.[A][OpenLeft]No, no[ToggleMouthMove]--[ToggleMouthMove]wait, please.[.][A]
Do you really know a route
through the mountains?[A][OpenRight]That's what I said.[.][A]
At the top of that mountain, there's
a village named Caer Pelyn.[.][A]
That's where my teacher lives.[A]
I'm sure he'll lead you through[.]
if you ask him nicely.[A][OpenFarLeft]What is your teacher's name?[A][OpenRight]My teacher?[.]
His name is Saleh.[A][OpenFarLeft]Saleh[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
I've heard that name on the lips of[.]
Frelia's spy network lately.[A]
He's a powerful wielder of magic who has
been fighting bandits and monsters.[.][A]
The spies mentioned something about[.]
a Caer Pelyn, if I remember.[A][OpenLeft]What do you think?[A][OpenFarLeft]Hm. If my spies are accurate, this
Saleh is someone we can trust.[A][OpenLeft]Very well, Ewan. Will you take us[.]
to meet your teacher?[.][A][OpenFarRight]Are you sure you can do this, Ewan?[.][A][OpenRight][MoveRight][OpenRight][ToggleSmile]Not a problem![A]

What's the good news?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Within our band of mercenaries[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]

They're usually diligent about making sure
this sort of thing doesn't happen.[A]
But here we are, two people of the same[.]
troop, working for opposite sides.[A][OpenMidRight]What should we do?[A][OpenMidLeft]Aye, well, that's a good question[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
As a mercenary, your loyalty should always
lie with the person paying your wages.[A]
You decide. We can cross blades if you
want, but I'd rather you retreat.[.][A]
'Course, if you betray your employer,[.]
you'll soil your sterling name.[.][A][OpenMidRight]C'mon, Chief.[.][A]
What would YOU like me to do?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Well, that's easy. I'd like you[.]
to come over and join my side.[A][OpenMidRight]Right. Done.[A][OpenMidLeft]Ho-hold on[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
Is that it? Just like that?[.][A]
You know what this will do to[.]
your reputation, right?[.][A][OpenMidRight]Uh-huh.[.][A]
[0A43]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x161][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0xFFFF][OpenMidLeft]Elder Pablo used his fortune to build[.]

It's a lot better than any stuffy,

You see, anyone can be a leader in
Carcino if he's old enough.[.][A]
Of course, maybe that's why the[.]
country's in such a mess right now.[.][A]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x15D][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0xFFFF][OpenMidLeft]I've heard that Prince Innes of Frelia
is a fantastic tactician.[.][A]
Grado took Renais with no trouble, but
Frelia still has yet to fall.[.][A]
They say it's because Prince Innes has spies
reporting every move the empire makes.[A]
At the same time, all enemy spies in Frelia[.]
are exposed and executed swiftly.[.][A]
That means that none of Frelia's secrets
are ever reported back to the empire.[.][A]
I've never met Prince Innes, but he doesn't[.]
sound like a man you'd want as an enemy.[A]

Don't take another step.[A][OpenFarRight][LoadFace][0x121][OpenFarRight]Huh?[A]
That's gonna make it awfully
hard to get where we need to go.[A][OpenFarLeft][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]What do you know about that fort?[.][A]
It looks like it's been abandoned[.]
for some time. Is anyone using it?[A][OpenFarRight]Nope. It's really run-down.[.]
Nobody ever goes there.[.][A]
It's been empty for ages. I've
been inside, so I know.[.][A][OpenFarLeft]Is that right? Then what's that sound,
and where is it coming from?[A][LoadOverworldFaces][OpenFarRight]Huh? What sound?[A]
Hey, you're right[.][ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]I do
hear a weird noise.[.][A]
You could hear that? Neat!
You've got really good hearing.[.][A]
I wonder what it is[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][LoadOverworldFaces][OpenLeft]There it is again.
Prince, is this[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenFarLeft]Eirika.[.][A][OpenLeft]Yes?[A][OpenFarLeft]Get your troops ready. Tell them
to prepare for battle[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
We've been spotted.[.]
Monsters are coming.[A]
[0A47]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x121][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x11C][OpenMidLeft]Ewan, it's dangerous here.
Get behind me.[A][OpenMidRight]No way. I'm gonna fight, too.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]No. You're too young.[.]
You're not ready for this.[A]
Are you going to do as
I say or not?[.][A]
I don't know what I would do
if you were to get injured.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Oh[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]OK.[.][A]
[0A48]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x121][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x10F][OpenMidLeft]Get out of the way, boy.[A]
You're no use in battle.[A][OpenMidRight]No way. I'm gonna fight, too.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]We don't need your help.
You'll just be in the way.[A]
You can get yourself killed[.]
when you're older.[A][OpenMidRight]Fine! I'll do what you say.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]You'd better do it quickly.[.][A]
Those beasts won't take it easy[.]
on you because you're young.[A]
[0A49]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x123][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x122][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]What spacious chambers.[.][A]
Hm[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]A bit musty, but
I like it.[A]
I've decided. We'll bed here
for the night.[A]
[ToggleSmile]I do wonder where Rennac
disappeared to, though.[.][A]
I told him not to wander
off, but[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]Hmph![.][A]
Lady L'Arachel,[.]
this could be trouble.[A][OpenMidLeft]What is it, Dozla?[A][OpenMidRight]Look there! Through that break
in the fog[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
Looks like we've got some nasty[.]
creatures running 'bout this place.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]I can't see a thing.[A]
[ToggleSmile]But this can be nothing but good
fortune shining down on us again.[.][A]
Losing our way in the mountains and[.]
running into these abominations?[A]
There can be no doubt: we were brought
here to destroy these foul things![A]
Come, Dozla! We fight![A][OpenMidRight][MoveMidRight][OpenMidRight]Gwah ha ha![.][A]
My heart cries out for battle![A]
[0A4A]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x122][OpenFarLeft][LoadFace][0x104][OpenLeft][LoadFace][0x102][OpenLeft]Thank you, L'Arachel.[.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Please, speak nothing of it.[A]
It is heaven's dictate that I come here to
cleanse this charming place of monsters.[A]
What's important is[.][ToggleMouthMove]--[ToggleMouthMove][A]
Oh my! I just realized I have not yet had[.]
the honor of your name.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenLeft]Oh, you're right.[.][A]
How strange[.][ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]We've met so often now
that I had assumed you already[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
Please forgive my lack of manners.
My name is Eirika.[A][OpenFarLeft]Milady[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenLeft]It's all right, Seth. She's[.]
clearly not our enemy.[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Eirika[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
Aha! So you must be Princess Eirika[.]
of Renais![A]
It is simply an honor to meet you.[A]
[ToggleSmile]And how strange that we should
meet again in this place.[.][A]
You must be lost as well.[.]
This continent is so confusing.[.][A][OpenLeft][ToggleSmile]Um, yes. Actually, we're not
lost at all.[A]
You see[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][ToggleSmile]
[0A4B]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x122][OpenFarLeft][LoadFace][0x104][OpenLeft][LoadFace][0x102][OpenLeft]Are you all right?
L'Arachel?[A][OpenMidRight]Uhnn[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]Can't believe it[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
Those foul wretches got the better of[.]
me. It must be part of heaven's plan[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
Oh! Something just struck me![.][A]
I just realized I have not yet had the
honor of your name.[.][A][OpenLeft]Oh, you're right.[.][A]
How strange[.][ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]We've met so often now
that I had assumed you already[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
Please forgive my lack of manners.
My name is Eirika.[A][OpenFarLeft]Milady[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenLeft]It's all right, Seth. She's[.]

[0A4C]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x122][OpenFarLeft][LoadFace][0x104][OpenLeft][LoadFace][0x102][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Is that so![.][A]
Well, clearly, I must be
allowed to accompany you.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenLeft]You want to travel with us?[.][A]
I appreciate your offer, but our
journey is far too perilous.[A]
I do not wish to pull you into
this madness.[.][A][OpenMidRight]No, no, no.[.][A][CloseSpeechSlow][OpenMidRight][CloseEyes][......][OpenMidRight][OpenEyes][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]There can be no doubt that we were
sent here to aid you.[.][A]
It is all part of the grand design.[.][A]
I, L'Arachel, shall play my role and
fulfill my divine duties. This I swear![.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenFarLeft]Are you sure this is wise, Princess?[A][OpenLeft]Don't worry, Seth.[A][CloseSpeechSlow]
[0A4D]
[ToggleSmile][OpenFarLeft][ClearFace][OpenLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x123][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]Well, that's that, Dozla.[.][A]
You and I are now traveling with
Eirika and her companions.[A][OpenMidLeft]Gwah ha ha![.]
I understand.[.][A]
For you, Lady L'Arachel, I
would do absolutely anything![.][A]
I would run to the ends of this[.]
world and dive into a sea of evil![A][OpenMidRight]How very like you, my dear,[.]
dedicated Dozla! So noble![A]
Come! We're off![A][OpenMidLeft]Gwah ha ha![.][A]
[0A4E]
[OpenLeft][LoadFace][0x121][OpenLeft][ToggleSmile]Teeeaaaacher[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
Hellooooooo[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][Clear]
That's strange.[.]
He's not here.[A]
Must be out wandering again.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenFarLeft][LoadFace][0x102][SendToBack][OpenFarLeft]He's out?[.][A]
That poses a problem.[.]
Do you know when he'll return?[A][OpenLeft]Hmmm[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]I don't know.[.][A]
He often goes out and looks[.]
for people in need.[.][A][OpenFarFarRight][LoadFace][0x120][OpenFarFarRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]I believe I told you
it would be best to stay away.[A][OpenFarFarRight][MoveFarRight][OpenFarRight]I've been charged with a mission
and must depart again soon.[.][A][OpenLeft][ToggleSmile]Ah! Teacher![A][ToggleSmile][OpenLeft][ClearFace][OpenRight][LoadFace][0x121][OpenFarLeft][MoveMidLeft][OpenMidLeft]Y-you[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
We've met before, haven't we?[.][A]
You were looking for someone[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenFarRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]Oh, yes.[A]
And now we meet again.[A][OpenRight]These people say they want to[.]
go through Caer Pelyn.[A]
I could guide them myself, but I thought
it might be better if you went, too.[A]
That's why I brought them here.[.][A]
What do you say? Will you guide them?[.][A][OpenFarRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft][MoveLeft][OpenLeft]Would you, please?[A][OpenFarRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]Very well. I'm heading
there now.[A]
If you need to go to Caer Pelyn,
you're free to follow me.[.][A][OpenLeft]You don't mind?[.][A][OpenFarRight]We have little interest in the outside
world, but we do not refuse travelers.[A][Clear]
I should warn you: the road is not
easy, and you look very weary.[A]
You should rest a night before
attempting the mountains.[.][A][OpenFarLeft][LoadFace][0x10F][OpenFarLeft]We do need rest, it's true.[.][A]
We are all exhausted from our[.]
encounter with those creatures.[.][A]
We must give our men time to heal, or[.]
they'll be useless in an emergency.[.][A][OpenRight][ToggleSmile]It's settled then. I'll go on ahead[.]
and let the elder know we're coming.[A]
See? Even when there's no fighting
to be done, I'm still useful![.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenRight][0x0080][LoadFace][0x00A]No, wait![.][A]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]He's gone. I wonder[.]
if he'll be all right.[A][OpenFarLeft]Idiotic boy.[A]
I understand his need[.]
to be helpful, but[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenFarRight]Ewan knows this land well.
You needn't worry about him.[A]
We'll depart at sunrise. I
suggest you all get some rest.[A]
[0A4F]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x102][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x14B][OpenMidRight]Princess Eirika of Renais.
Hold.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Who?[A]
You[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
You're General Glen of Grado.[.][A]
We met once in the capital, didn't we?[A]
You were very kind to me.[.][A]
However, if you're here now, I have[.]
to assume this means[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]Yes, it does. I wish our reunion could
come under different circumstances.[.][A]
Eirika, I must tell you, I come here
on the direct orders of the emperor.[A]
I'm to bring to justice the rebel army
leader who's been terrorizing Carcino.[A]
It's you, Eirika. They say you've been
murdering innocents.[A][OpenMidLeft]What?[.][A]
Wait! What do you mean?[.]
I[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]If you have something to say,[.]
I would hear it.[A]
I know all too well that Grado has robbed[.]
you of your homeland, but even so[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
I do not believe revenge could drive
a woman like you to such depths.[A][CloseSpeechSlow][OpenMidRight]And yet[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]here you are in Carcino with
a small army under your command.[A]
And the emperor tells us that you[.]
massacred everyone in Port Kiris.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]That[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]That's a lie![.][A]
I could never[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]Go on.[A][OpenMidLeft][MoveFarLeft][OpenLeft][LoadFace][0x10F][LoadOverworldFaces][OpenLeft][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]This is ridiculous.[.]
Believe what you want.[A]
Could one of the legendary Imperial[.]
Three honestly be as stupid as this?[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]What do you mean?[.][A][OpenLeft]Carcino betrayed Frelia and set[.]
a pack of mercenary dogs to kill me.[A]
And you paint Eirika a rebel instigator?
It's an absurd farce.[.][A]
Your emperor commits horrors, and you[.]
believe Eirika is a criminal?[.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]What are you saying?[A][OpenLeft]You truly are blind, aren't you?[A]
You're one of the Imperial Three, and[.]
yet you can't see your emperor's plan?[A][OpenFarLeft]That's enough, Prince Innes. There's
no need to provoke him.[.][A]
General Glen, we've told you what we know[.]
to be true, what we've seen firsthand.[A]
We don't want to fight you[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
But if you push us, we will drive you back
to Grado with your tail between your legs.[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]I see.[A]
You[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]are more observant than you know.[.]
I am ignorant of the emperor's designs.[.][A]
General Duessel and I both questioned[.]
the wisdom of this war.[.][A][Clear]
And if you really are innocent of the[.]
crimes attributed to you[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
Why would His Majesty lie to us?
I must know the answer.[.][A][OpenFarLeft]So, you[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]believe us?[.][A][OpenMidRight]The Princess Eirika I met long ago was
kind and merciful in spirit.[A]
You've faced relentless hardship, and yet[.]
that selfsame spirit remains true.[A][Clear]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]Let's put our fight aside for now.[A]
I will learn the truth. Then I will once
again perform the duties of my office.[A]
If you have lied to me today, I will
hound you to the very grave itself.[.][A][OpenFarLeft]Very well[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[0A50]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x14B][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x142][OpenMidRight]Glen. Where do you think you're going?[A][OpenMidLeft]Valter[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]Tsk, tsk. What am I to make of this?[A]
Those little birds I saw flitting away
into the mountains looked vaguely familiar.[.][A]
What do you suppose would happen if it
were known you let Eirika escape?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Do as you will.[.][A]
I'm returning to the capital.[.]
I have questions for the emperor.[.][A]
Clear the path, Valter.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Hold on now. No reason
to rush off, is there?[A]
After all, this is where
you're going to die. See?[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]What are you babbling about?[A][OpenMidRight]Heh heh[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
We were a grand trio[ToggleMouthMove]--[ToggleMouthMove]the Imperial
Three: you, Duessel, and me.[A]
But my place among you was stolen,
and I was exiled from Grado.[A][OpenMidLeft]You slaughtered people who had
no intention of fighting.[.][A]
The emperor's punishment was
just and warranted.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Heh heh[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]heh heh heh[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
After my fall from glory, only desire[.]
kept me alive. Desire for revenge.[A]
My hatred burned so fierce that I was[.]
only barely able to keep my sanity.[.][A]
That hatred keeps me warm still[.]
today. Oh, how it burns[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A][LoadOverworldFaces][OpenMidRight]Hear me, Glen, wyvern general[.]
of the Imperial Three.[A]
I live for battle. I crave it.
I have no need for peace.[.][A]
That is why you must die.[.][A]
[0A51]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x14B][OpenMidRight]Cur! You're mad![A][OpenMidRight][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x142][OpenMidLeft]A battle between generals[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
Sends the spirit soaring, eh?[.][A]
Come, Glen! Entertain me![.]
Ha ha ha ha ha ha![A][OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x14B][OpenMidRight]Urrgh[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight][ClearFace]
[0A52]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x142][OpenMidRight]Go. The small fish are yours.[.][A]
[0A53]
[ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x142][OpenMidRight]Heh heh[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
This is merely the beginning.[.]
Endless battle, war without end[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][Clear]
Heh heh[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]ha hahahahahaha![A]
[0A54]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x102][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x122][OpenMidLeft]You[.][ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]L'Arachel![A][OpenMidRight]Hello![A]
So it's true! Blessings[.]
do come in threes![A][OpenMidLeft]L'Arachel, this place is dangerous.[.]
You should find safe haven elsewhere.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Oh, you needn't worry about us.[.][A]
As you well know, my divine mission is
to purge the land of these obscenities.[.][A]
I will show you the splendor that is
L'Arachel in action! Bear witness![A][OpenMidLeft]If you insist. At least let us
join forces for the time being.[.][A]
[0A55]
[ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x122][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x123][OpenMidLeft]Dozla.[A][OpenMidRight]Gwah ha ha! What is it,[.]
Lady L'Arachel?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]We're going to join these good people and[.]
eradicate these unclean monstrosities.[A][OpenMidRight]Sounds fun! What would
you have me do?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Oh, just carry on in your normal
manner: destroy, destroy, destroy.[A]
But do be sure to enjoy yourself.[.][A][OpenMidRight][MoveMidRight][OpenMidRight]Gwah ha ha! I am your[.]
obedient servant![.][A]
[0A56]
[OpenLeft][LoadFace][0x102][OpenLeft][HalfCloseEyes][OpenLeft][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]Hh[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]hh[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenLeft][OpenEyes][OpenFarLeft][LoadFace][0x104][OpenFarLeft]Perhaps we should rest, milady.[.][A][Clear]
Master Saleh, is it much farther?[.][A][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x120][OpenMidRight]We're close. It's only half a day ahead.[A][OpenFarLeft]I would ask for a moment's rest[.]
before continuing.[A]
We are all exhausted. We can
go no farther today.[A][OpenLeft]No, Seth. I'll be fine. We must[.]
not be delayed by my weakness.[A][OpenFarLeft][ClearFace][OpenFarLeft][LoadFace][0x10F][SendToBack][OpenFarLeft]Whew[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]Hah[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
I didn't realize we'd be
climbing so high.[.][A][OpenLeft][MoveLeft][OpenLeft]Whoops![.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]As I warned you before we set out,
the footing here can be treacherous.[A][OpenFarLeft]Do you people truly live
in this place?[A]
These barren crags seem unfit[.]
for human habitation[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]Material wealth brings strife.
We've no need of these things.[A]
In this, we are of one mind with
the Great Dragon.[.][A][LoadOverworldFaces][OpenLeft]The Great Dragon?[.][A]
[0A57]
[OpenFarLeft][LoadFace][0x102][OpenFarRight][LoadFace][0x120][OpenRight][LoadFace][0x122][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x104][OpenMidLeft][MoveLeft][OpenLeft]Ah! Princess Eirika,
watch out![A][OpenFarLeft]More monsters[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
Master Saleh, do these creatures
normally inhabit this region?[.][A][OpenFarRight]No[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]Those things come from
Darkling Woods.[.][A]
It's been a long time since they've[.]
wandered this far afield.[.][A]
It's as the elder says[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
Evil omens take many shapes.[A][OpenRight]It looks like those fiends have[.]
noticed us as well.[.][A]
We should move, Eirika.[.][A]
[0A58]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x120][OpenMidRight]I'm concerned for Ewan as[.]
well. I'll go with you.[.][A]
I hope he is safe.[A]
[0A59]
[OpenLeft][LoadFace][0x121][OpenLeft][MoveLeft][OpenLeft]Hey! Wa-wait a moment.
We can work this out[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenLeft][MoveMidLeft][OpenMidLeft]You, uh, aren't interested in[.]
talking, are you?[.][A][OpenMidLeft][MoveFarLeft][OpenFarLeft][MoveFarLeft][OpenFarLeft]Aaaaaa[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenFarLeft][MoveFarFarLeft]
[0A5A]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x121][OpenMidRight]Where'd all those freaks come from?[.][A]
I've got to get back and warn[.]
everyone[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
But[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]I do wonder if Grandmother

[0A5B]
[OpenFarFarLeft][LoadFace][0x121][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x120][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]Ewan.[.][A][OpenFarFarLeft][MoveMidLeft][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Ah! Teacher!
I'm so glad to see you.[.][A]
[ToggleSmile]I was beginning to think you'd
all forgotten about me.[.][A][OpenMidRight]It was careless of me to let you
rush off on your own.[.][A]
And I can't let you stay here[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
Will you come with me?[A][OpenMidLeft][MoveMidLeft][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Really? Can I?[A]
Woohoo![.]
I won't let you down![.][A][ToggleSmile]
[0A5C]
[ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x121][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x11C][OpenMidRight]Ewan! So this is where you've[.]
wandered off to![A][OpenMidLeft]Oh, Tethys.[.]
I'm so glad to see you.[.][A]
I was beginning to think you'd
all forgotten about me.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Don't be foolish. I could never[.]
forget my little brother.[.][A]
Come on. We've got to[.]
get going.[A][OpenMidLeft][MoveMidLeft][OpenMidLeft]All right! And I've got something[.]
to show you, too.[.][A]
I know I've been hiding but[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
Next enemy to show its face is gonna
get a blast of magic![.][A][OpenMidRight]You're such a rascal, Ewan.[.][A]
[0A5D]
[OpenFarLeft][LoadFace][0x120][OpenRight][LoadFace][0x155][OpenRight]Saleh? Is that you, Saleh?[A]
Tell me, is the Great Dragon well?[A][OpenFarLeft]I'm sorry, Elder.[.][A]
I searched to the west,[.]
but I found nothing.[A][OpenRight]Is that so[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][Clear]
Hm?[.]
Who's that with you?[A][OpenFarLeft][ClearFace][OpenLeft][LoadFace][0x102][OpenFarLeft][LoadFace][0x10F][SendToBack][OpenFarLeft]I am Innes, prince of Frelia.[.][A]
The circumstances of our journey have[.]
led us here. We would like to pass through.[.][A][OpenLeft]Please.[.][A][OpenRight]Hmmm[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
We of Caer Pelyn have turned away[.]
from the world outside.[.][A]
The Great Dragon alone holds all
our honor and esteem.[.][A]
In this place, princes and
paupers are equals.[.][A]
Do you have a problem with that?[A][OpenFarLeft][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]No. I understand.[.][A][OpenRight]Hm[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]Well then, be welcomed as[.]
guests in our homes.[A]
I see some of you are injured.
You should use this rock moss.[A]
We have little beyond what we need,[.]
but we will prepare food and bedding.[.][A]
You can rest as long as you like.[.][A][OpenFarLeft]We've no wish to trouble you. We'd just[.]
as soon pass straight through.[A][OpenRight]Don't let your pride drive you
to foolishness.[.][A]
That girl there looks like she's
ready to collapse any moment.[.][A]
She's ill from the height of the mountain.

that watches over all mankind.[A]
Why, in days long past, when the
Demon King appeared[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][ToggleSmile][OpenLeft]Demon King? Are you speaking of the[.]
legend of the Sacred Stones?[A]
The hero Grado used the power of the five[.]
Sacred Stones to defeat and seal away[.][ToggleMouthMove]--[ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenRight]No, no, that's not right at all.[A]
Ah, how quickly did mankind forget
its debt to the Great Dragon.[.][A]
To hear the story now, one would think
humans alone brought about victory.[.][A]
That is a gross mistelling of the tale.[.][A]
Only through the Great Dragon's strength
could the Demon King be sealed away![A][OpenLeft]The Great Dragon and the Demon King[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenRight]Mankind may have forgotten its debt,
but the Great Dragon never forgets.[.][A]
It watches over the bones of the Demon
King in Darkling Woods.[.][A]
It keeps the Demon King's dark brood
from swarming the world of men.[.][A]
The Great Dragon's vigilance alone has
kept us safe from their blind rage.[.][A][OpenLeft]Is that so? I'm[.][ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]I'm[.]
sorry, I never knew[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenRight]Hmph. You don't need to know everything,
but you should remember that.[.][A][OpenLeft]Yet, Grandmother, we encountered
those creatures on the way here.[A]
And they have begun to appear in
the lands we live in as well.[.][A]
What does this mean?[A][LoadOverworldFaces][OpenRight]Ah[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]You have seen the effects of the
omen that has appeared in the south.[A][Clear]
There is an energy there that has[.]
fouled the air and darkened the sky.[A]
The Great Dragon left Darkling Woods and
went south to investigate.[A]
We of the village wished to protect the[.]
Great Dragon, and so I sent my grandson,[A]
Saleh, along as well.[.][A]
But they became embroiled in battle, and
the Great Dragon disappeared.[.][A]
Since that time, there's been no sign of
the Great Dragon either here or abroad.[.][A]
We grew worried and directed Saleh to[.]
look for any trace of the Great Dragon.[.][A]
I am worried that the source of that
foul energy may be responsible.[.][A][OpenLeft]A foul energy[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
From the south?[.][A]
Myrrh said something
similar to this, too.[.][A]
Is the Great Dragon you speak[.]
of[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]one of the Manakete?[A][OpenRight]Manakete?!?[.][A]
How dare you speak so[.]
of the Great Dragon![A][OpenLeft]I-I'm sorry.[A][OpenRight]But if you've seen the noble Myrrh,[.]
perhaps I can proceed more quickly.[.][A]
You see, our Great Dragon took the
form of Mistress Myrrh in her travels.[A]
And you tell me that you have seen
the Great Dragon yourself, lass?[A][OpenLeft]Yes. Myrrh was with my brother.[.][A][OpenRight]What?![A]
Where is this brother[.]
of yours!?[A][OpenLeft]He leads a force of men against[.]
Grado. Myrrh rides beside him.[A][OpenRight]Saleh, this is urgent![A]
You must leave for Grado at once
and rescue the Great Dragon![A][OpenFarRight]Understood. I will[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenFarLeft]Oh, where are you off to?[.][A]
If you're going to Grado, the swiftest
route takes you through Jehanna.[A]
It would be to your advantage to
join us in our journey for a time.[A]
It's far safer than being on your own.[A][OpenFarRight]You have a point[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
Mistress Eirika, protecting[.]
the Great Dragon is my duty.[A]
Please allow me to travel[.]
with you on the road ahead.[.][A]
[0A5F]
[OpenLeft][LoadFace][0x102][OpenFarLeft][LoadFace][0x10F][OpenFarRight][LoadFace][0x120][OpenRight][LoadFace][0x155][OpenFarLeft]We are in your debt, Matron.[A][OpenRight]Not at all. All of our guidance[.]

Saleh.[A][OpenFarRight]Yes, I know.[A]
The road to Jehanna lies here.[A][OpenFarRight][ClearFace][OpenLeft]Grandmother, thank you so[.]
much for everything.[A][OpenRight]I know you'll help the Great Dragon,
but please look after Saleh as well.[A]
He's not very personable, but he's
the only grandchild I have.[.][A]
[0A60]
[OpenLeft][LoadFace][0x102][OpenFarLeft][LoadFace][0x10F][OpenRight][LoadFace][0x155][SendToBack][OpenRight]Hm?[.]
And who might you be?[.][A][OpenFarLeft]I am Innes, prince of Frelia.[.][A]
The circumstances of our journey have[.]
led us here. We would like to pass through.[.][A][OpenLeft]Please.[.][A][OpenRight]Hmmm[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
We of Caer Pelyn have turned away[.]
from the world outside.[.][A]
The Great Dragon alone holds all
our honor and esteem.[.][A]
In this place, princes and
paupers are equals.[.][A]
Do you have a problem with that?[A][OpenFarLeft][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]No. I understand.[.][A][OpenRight]Hm[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]Well then, be welcomed as[.]
guests in our homes.[A]
I see some of you are injured.
You should use this rock moss.[A]
We have little beyond what we need,[.]
but we will prepare food and bedding.[.][A]
You can rest as long as you like.[.][A][OpenFarLeft]We've no wish to trouble you. We'd just[.]
as soon pass straight through.[A][OpenRight]Don't let your pride drive you
to foolishness.[.][A]
That girl there looks like she's
ready to collapse any moment.[.][A]
She's ill from the height of the mountain.
Let me prepare some tea for the lass.[.][A][OpenLeft][ToggleSmile]Thank you, Elder[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][ToggleSmile][OpenRight][ToggleSmile]Call me Grandmother, child. That
is what the villagers call me.[A][Clear]
Oh, yes[.][ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]Tell me, did you happen to
meet Saleh on your way here?[A]
He should be returning anytime now.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove]
Master Saleh, he[ToggleMouthMove]--[ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenFarLeft]That man is dead. He fell[.]
fighting abominations.[A][OpenRight]Is that so?[.][A]
Worthless fool[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
That he should die before me.[.][A][OpenLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]

[OpenLeft][LoadFace][0x102][OpenFarLeft][LoadFace][0x10F][OpenRight][LoadFace][0x155][SendToBack][OpenLeft]Uh[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]Grandmother, may I
ask you a question?[.][A]
This Great Dragon[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenRight][ToggleSmile]Ah, the inquisitiveness of youth.[.][A]

[OpenLeft][LoadFace][0x102][OpenFarLeft][LoadFace][0x10F][OpenRight][LoadFace][0x155][OpenFarLeft]We are in your debt, Matron.[A][OpenRight]Not at all. All of our guidance[.]

I'll have someone from the village

much for everything.[A][OpenRight]When you meet your brother, please ask
that he watch over the Great Dragon.[A]
More than anything we hope and

[0A63]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x160][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0xFFFF][OpenMidLeft]I can't believe monsters have appeared
here in the realm of the Great Dragon.[A]
What is this world coming to?[.][A]
This staff should help to protect you[.]
against the beasts.[.][A]
Please travel safely.[.][A]
[0A64]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x121][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102][OpenMidLeft][MoveMidLeft][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Ah, hello![A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]Ewan! How wonderful.
So you're safe, are you?[A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yep. I took care of a whole mess
of those things.[A]
More of 'em might show up at any time,
so I'll just follow you to the village.[.][A]
That's all right, isn't it?[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]I guess so[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
It's probably safer than leaving
you here by yourself.[.][A]
Let's stick together, Ewan.[.][A][OpenMidLeft][MoveMidLeft][OpenMidLeft]Wahoo![A]
[0A65]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x121][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x120][OpenMidRight]Ewan[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]You're safe.[A][OpenMidLeft][MoveMidLeft][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Oh, Teacher! It's you![A]
You probably had to fight a[.]

You're the best! I hope I can[.]
study with you forever.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]I've told you before[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
My mission is my life.[A]
If you wish to learn magic, you'd[.]
be better served by another.[A][OpenMidLeft]No way. I wanna be just like you. Why[.]
would I go study somewhere else?[A]
Wait[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]You've gotta go out on
a mission again, don't you![.][A]
Take me with you! I've practiced a lot. I can[.]
already use all the magic you taught me![A][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
Well, you seem quite adamant.[.]
All right. You may accompany me.[A]
I think being with me might be
safer than remaining on your own.[.][A][OpenMidLeft][MoveMidLeft][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yahoo![A][ToggleSmile]

Are you all right?[A][OpenMidLeft]Yeah.[.][A]
I tried to fight those monsters.[A]
And you know what? I killed four
of 'em! With my magic![A]
That's pretty good, huh?[A][OpenMidRight]What am I going to do with you?[.][A]
Anyway, it's not safe here.[.]
Come with me, Ewan.[.][A][OpenMidLeft][MoveMidLeft][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
You-you don't believe me[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]

[0A67]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x121][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0xFFFF][OpenMidLeft]You were one of the people with my

You think I can fight at your side? I can[.]
use the magic my teacher taught me.[.][A]
Well, what do you say?[A]
[0A68]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x113][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x142][OpenMidLeft]My brother is[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]dead?[.][A]
That can't be!
That's impossible![A][OpenMidRight]There's no mistake.[.]
Look for yourself.[A]
I've brought his corpse with me.
That's him right over there, isn't it?[A][OpenMidLeft]No[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
Brother[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]Not a pretty sight, eh? You'll be hard
pressed to ready that for a proper burial.[A]
But listen, Cormag. There's no reason for[.]
you to grieve.[A]
After all, who better than you to replace[.]
your brother in His Majesty's service?[A]
Picture it: General Cormag, the new and[.]
improved Sunstone, eh?[A][OpenMidLeft]Who did this[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
Who is responsible? Who!?[.][A][OpenMidRight]Glen's last orders were to find[.]
and subdue Eirika.[A]
'Tis a pity I was delayed. I arrived
to witness the final blow myself.[.][A]
I watched Eirika run her blade right
through his chest and then flee.[A][OpenMidLeft]Eirika?![A]
Where is she now?[.][A][OpenMidRight]Hm? What would you do if I told you?
Without orders from His Majesty[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]ANSWER ME![A][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]In the eastern mountains of Carcino.[A]
The forests are thick in that region.[.]
It won't be easy finding her, but[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[0A69]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x142][OpenMidLeft]Gone already?[.][A]
I've sent a gift your way, Eirika,

I bring word from Frelia![.][A][OpenFarRight]Go on. What news do you bring?[A][OpenMidLeft]Prince Innes![.]
You're alive and well![A][Clear]
When the reinforcements rode into Carcino,
you were nowhere to be seen[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
We thought perhaps the enemy forces[.]
had reached you and[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
It's good to see you well, milord.[A][OpenFarRight]I'm sorry to have troubled you.[.][A]
But remember, the duty I bear is a harsh
master. It will not let me die easily.[A][OpenMidLeft]Of course. Prince Innes[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenFarRight]Yes, what word do you bring[.]
of Frelia? Speak![.][A][OpenMidLeft]Yes, Your Highness![.][A]
Frelia has invaded Carcino and engaged
the traitor Pablo's mercenary army.[.][A]
With aid from Elder Klimt, we are crushing
the foe where we find them.[.][A]
Pablo's faction is retreating ever
southward, toward Jehanna[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenFarRight]Towards Jehanna?[A]
They must be planning to join[.]
with the Grado forces there.[A][OpenRight]Pardon me, but I must know[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
Do you have word of my brother?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Yes.[A]
Prince Ephraim has forced the surrender[.]
of Grado's fortress at Rigwald.[.][A]
He is now marching onward toward
the imperial capital.[.][A][OpenRight]Toward the capital[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenFarRight]That fool[.][ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]Emperor Vigarde himself and his[.]

It's too strong a force[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
Even for Ephraim.[.][A][OpenRight]No[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
I believe in my brother.[A]
I know he fights still.[.]
This bracelet tells me so.[A]
[0A6B]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x102][OpenFarFarRight][LoadFace][0x122][OpenFarFarRight][MoveFarRight][OpenFarRight]Ah, Eirika. Is it time to go already?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]L'Arachel.[A]
We're going to break through the Grado
lines and join the army of Jehanna.[.][A]
You should keep to the rear where it's
safe[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenFarRight][MoveMidRight][OpenMidRight]No, I will stay with you.[.][A]
Confronting evil boldly is the sworn
duty of any ally of justice.[A]
And it may be that Grado's goal is the
Stone of Jehanna[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
I cannot stand by and let it
be destroyed.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]L'Arachel?[A]
Where did you come by[.]

That[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]uh, well[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]the[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]wind
whispered to me in the night.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]The wind? Whispered to you?[.][A][OpenMidRight]Yes, that's right.
[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]And according to that gentle breeze,[A]
there are knights riding this way[.]
from Rausten even as we speak.[A]
If we can but hold out until they arrive,[.]
the battle will surely be ours.[.][A]
Come, Eirika. Let us be on our way.[.][A][OpenMidRight][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft]W-wait a moment.
L'Arachel? Who are you?[.][A]
[0A6C]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x13B][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x143][OpenMidRight]They should be arriving anytime now.
Are you ready, Aias?[A][OpenMidLeft]Mm.[.]
Everything's in place.[A]
This Princess Eirika supposedly[.]
defeated General Glen.[A]
I wonder[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]If it's true, then she's a
foe to be reckoned with, and no doubt.[A]
Still, there's no reason to worry.
I can best her. I know it.[A][OpenMidRight]You'll take her, I've no fear.[A]
We fought as mercenaries together,
and I know what you're capable of.[A]
I could search the continent over and[.]
not find a man to match your skills.[A][OpenMidLeft]I'm honored to hear you say that.[.][A]
But I've no interest in the titles
and trappings of Grado's Imperial Army.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Don't say that. You're glad you came
with me, right?[.][A]
You know we were both sick to death[.]
of living like desert rats.[.][A]
I'm going to be a king one day.[.]
This war is just the beginning.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Ah[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]It starts again.[A][OpenMidRight]Word has it that the Knights of Rausten[.]
are riding from the north. They're mine.[A]
I can trust this mess to your capable[.]
hands, can't I, Aias?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]You remember what they called me
when we were mercenaries, don't you?[A]
I was never once wounded on the[.]
field of battle. Not once[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
My skill is not garish and loud like yours,[.]
but I've never known defeat.[A][OpenMidRight]Yes, that is true.[A]
I'm depending on you, Aias.[.][A][OpenMidRight][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A][Clear]

We've word that Pablo's mercenary army
is closing in from the rear.[A]
You must be cautious.[.][A][OpenFarLeft]All we have to do is hold them off
until the Knights of Rausten arrive.[A]
If we can do that, victory is as
good as ours.[.][A]
Let's get started,
shall we, Eirika?[.][A][OpenLeft]Indeed![.][A]
[0A6E]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x13A][OpenFarFarRight][LoadFace][0x16D][OpenFarFarRight][MoveFarRight][OpenFarRight]Elder Pablo, there's fighting ahead.[A][OpenMidLeft]Grr[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]I've misread the situation.[.][A]
I can't believe I've been forced
out of Carcino.[.][A]
It's those accursed Frelian knights[.]
riding down on us from the north.[.][A]
If things don't change quickly, I'll be[.]
forced to appeal to Grado for aid.[A][Clear]
We must prove ourselves worthy allies of
Grado. We must have them in our debt![.][A]
First, I'll use my magic to bury those
enemies in the distance.[A]
[0A6F]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x113][OpenMidLeft]Where is she?[.]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x13B][OpenMidLeft]It's not over yet. Victory
still hangs in the balance.[.][A]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x13B][OpenMidLeft]Very[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]impressive.[.][A]

Here, come with me.[.][A][OpenMidRight]But[.][ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]But I'm[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]I'm Franz, a Knight of Renais.[A]
What's your name?[.]
What are you doing here?[A][OpenMidRight]I-I'm Amelia.[.][A]
I'm[.][ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]Actually, I'm a Grado soldier.
I'm supposed to be fighting you.[A][OpenMidLeft]Really?[.][A]
So, uh, you're my enemy?[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]I guess[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
Are you[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
Are you going to make[.]

stop the princess of Renais[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]Huh?[A]
You're with Grado?[A][OpenMidRight]And you're Princess Eirika?[.][A]
But the commander said Eirika's[.]
a cruel and merciless fiend[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]What? No, I'm[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]I don't know what Grado's[.]
officers have been telling you, but[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
Our two countries are at war, so I
suppose they can say what they want.[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]Mistress Eirika[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
I, uh, I surrender.[.]
I won't fight you.[A][OpenMidLeft]Huh?[A][OpenMidRight]I became a soldier because I admired
General Duessel's sense of honor.[.][A]
But the general has been very opposed[.]
to this war from the beginning[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
And now I see you, and you look so
sad about all of this.[A]
I don't know what's right anymore.[A][Clear]
I'm just a soldier, but I want to[.]
decide for myself.[A]
I want to understand the truth
myself, to see it with my own eyes.[.][A] [.][OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]I see.[A]
So[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]does this mean you're coming with us?[.]
I suppose I should ask your name then.[A][OpenMidRight]Amelia. Amelia of Silva.[A]
[0A80]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x102][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x113][OpenMidRight]You're Eirika, aren't you?[A][OpenMidLeft]And you're[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]You don't know me, but you know my
brother well enough. I'm Cormag.[A]
I'm the brother of Glen, general
of the Grado army, whom you killed.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]What?[.][A][OpenMidRight]This is no longer war, and this is
not a battlefield.[A]
This is a duel, and I fight to avenge[.]
my brother.[.][A]
He died in combat, and I'll not foul
his name by murdering you unarmed.[A][Clear]
But I will have vengeance.[A][OpenMidLeft]Hold![.]
What is the meaning of this?[A]
Glen[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]Are you telling me
General Glen is dead?[.][A][OpenMidRight]Do not play me for a fool!
You will not[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
Your lies do nothing but stain
your honor. Nothing more.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]You've got it wrong!
You're making a mistake.[A]
Your brother and I never fought.[A]
He lowered his lance and left the[.]
battlefield to confront your emperor.[.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]My brother?[.][A]
You lie! Where
is your proof?[A][OpenMidLeft]I've no proof. But[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
Here are the words he spoke to me.[A]
He told me he believed I possessed
a gentle heart when we met before.[A]
He said I had not lost that quality[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
I see[.][ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]Those are indeed
my brother's words.[.][A]
But then who? Who benefits from[.][ToggleMouthMove]--[ToggleMouthMove][A][Clear]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]Ah![.][A]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]Valter![.][A][OpenMidLeft]What is it?[.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]Princess Eirika of Renais.[A]
I would be your ally.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]What?[.][A][OpenMidRight]I don't care why you're fighting.[.]
I've no interest in your goals.[.][A][Clear]
I want nothing but revenge, and[.]
I will have it.[.][A]
If I can kill Valter with these two hands,
what care I if Grado brands me traitor?[.][A]
[0A81]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x12D][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x150][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]I yield.
The point is yours, Eirika.[.][A]
You're swift, aren't you?[.]
Compared to you, I'm[ToggleMouthMove]--[ToggleMouthMove][A]
I've been bested at fencing by a woman.[.]
Pitiful crown prince, am I not?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]That's not true[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]Oh, no, Eirika. It is. The people[.]
need a strong ruler.[A]
They don't want a weakling like me. They
want the strength you and Ephraim share.[A][Clear]
My body is frail. I prefer to spend my
time locked away in the castle, reading[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
I think my father would be better served
if someone else took my place.[A]
I'm sure all of our retainers feel
the same[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]You're wrong, Lyon.[.][A]
An emperor without compassion will
never hold the people's love.[.][A]
And one day, your compassion will[.]
surely save us all.[.][A]
I believe that.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]Eirika[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]Thank you.[A][Clear]
Yes.
I[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]I will do my best.[A]
Even though I lack your strength,[.]
there must be some good I can do.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]There is.[.][A][OpenMidRight]By the way, Eirika[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
If it please you, would you[.]
accept this?[A]
[0A82]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x102][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x104][OpenMidRight]Princess Eirika?
Is there something wrong?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]N-no.[.]
It's nothing.[.][A][LoadOverworldFaces][OpenMidRight]Jehanna Hall has been completely
occupied by Grado soldiers.[.][A]
I'm sorry to report that Queen
Ismaire is already[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight][ClearFace][OpenRight][LoadFace][0x10F][OpenRight]And the one giving orders to the troops[.]
in the palace is Crown Prince Lyon?[.][A][OpenFarRight][LoadFace][0x122][OpenFarRight]What is there to give us pause?[.][A]
Should we not storm the palace and
retake it by strength of arms?[A][OpenRight]Frelia's spy network reports that Prince
Lyon is an initiate of dark magic.[A]
If this is true, even approaching him[.]
will be a serious challenge.[A]
I'd heard the prince dislikes violence.[.]
However, it could all have been a ruse.[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenRight]Still, if we don't retake the palace,[.]
we've no hope of defeating Grado.[.][A]
We must rescue the queen, no matter[.]
the cost[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]I understand. Let's go![.][A]
[0A83]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x156][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x13C][OpenMidRight]Queen Ismaire[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
Please do not resist.[.][A]
I have no desire to see[.]
you harmed.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Carlyle[.][ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]Why have you betrayed us?[.][A]
After all these years of loyal service
as Jehanna's most decorated commander[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][Clear]
Without you, I could not have ruled these[.]
long years since my husband's passing.[A]
It was through your unwavering support
alone that I still sit upon the throne.[.][A]
You are the cornerstone of Jehanna. You[.]
have held my trust more than any man.[.][A]
So tell me why. Why have you betrayed[.]
us? Why have you betrayed me?[.][A][OpenMidRight]Your Highness[.][ToggleMouthMove]-- [.][ToggleMouthMove]No[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
My queen[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]Ismaire[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
It is your own fault.[.][A][Clear]
You are too lovely, my queen.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Carlyle[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]The first time I met you,[.]
twenty years ago now[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
I saw you in the garden[.]
of this very palace[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
and I was bewitched.[A]
Your pale beauty far surpassed
that of any flower.[.][A][Clear]
I was in the grips of an
unforgivable desire[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
You were the wife of my king, to
whom I'd sworn life and loyalty.[A]
I told myself a grand lie that day.[.][A]
I told myself I could be happy simply[.]
serving you as your most loyal knight.[A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]After years of duty, years of service,
years of[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]of silence[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
I became aware once more of the feelings
I'd buried deep within myself.[A]
How could I leave this world without
expressing my true desires?[.][A]
Could anything be more desolate?
More devoid of meaning?[.][A]
That is when I made my decision.[A]
I would follow my heart and claim[.]
your hand as my own.[A][OpenMidLeft]Carlyle[.][ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]You forget yourself.[A]
You ruin our country and kill our[.]
countrymen.[.][A]
Did you think I would be pleased? Did[.]
you think I would love you for this?[A][OpenMidRight]I need no country. I care[.]
nothing for my countrymen.[A]
I can see nothing but you.
If you would only be mine[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]Carlyle[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x16B][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x124][OpenMidLeft]To arms, mercenaries. We're under attack![.][A]
You there! Ready your weapons![A][OpenMidRight]What?!? No, no, no. That
was never part of the deal.[.][A]
The only fight I'm here for is with[.]
the locks of the treasure chamber.[A][OpenMidLeft]Hah[.][ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]Don't get so excited.[.][A]
I doubt you mercenaries will see any
action at all once we soldiers've finished.[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidRight]Yeah, great. You go do that.[A]
Whew[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]With all these soldiers around,[.]
I shouldn't have to lift a finger.[A]
I'll just sit here and wait for them
to win the day. Then, I collect my pay![.][A]
No more being ordered around by that selfish
princess and her moronic bodyguard.[.][A]
This is the life.[.]

My palace[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
Oh, how I do like the[.]
sound of that.[A][OpenMidLeft]Do whatever you want with the[.]

You twitch, and the queen dies.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Blackheart! What is the[.]
meaning of this?[A][OpenMidRight]Calm down. You'll get her back as[.]
soon as I'm done with her.[A]
Jehanna's Sacred Stone is around
here somewhere.[.][A]
I've got to find it and destroy it.[.][A]
I need this woman to guide me to
its hiding place.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Do not lay a hand on my queen![A][OpenMidRight]Don't get so incensed.
I'm not going to harm her.[A]
I'm not like that freak Valter.[.]
I'm kind to women.[A]
But if you make a wrong move, you'll
lose your prize. Understood?[A][OpenMidLeft]Yes[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]There are some annoying pests outside[.]

I want you to take care of them. Lose,

harm in your care[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]Yes, of course. I know all about

When the rebellion began, you went
straight to the palace altar.[.][A]
You had hoped to prevent us from
smashing the Sacred Stone.[A]
But you have the Stone of Jehanna[.]
with you right now, don't you?[A][OpenFarLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight][MoveRight][OpenRight]Hand it over. Cooperate,

If you resist, I'll just kill[.]

You mustn't harm her, Caellach[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenRight]Shut up, Prince. My orders come[.]

I wrote a farewell and left the palace,[.]

I felt I could never understand the people

I abandoned my identity and roamed
the continent, working where I could.[.][A]
I wanted only to be worthy of becoming
king. I knew one day I would return.[A][Clear]

a child, I see it now.[A]
Was I simply rebelling against my mother?[.]
Punishing her for tending to her duties?[A][OpenFarLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenRight]I was a fool, yes, but I learned much[.]
over these ten years.[.][A]
I have learned about the hearts of our
people, how they need to be governed.[.][A]
I have learned how our country needs

I have learned much, but I've lost
much more. Mother[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenFarLeft]Prince Joshua[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenRight]I made a promise. I want to continue

Did anyone get left behind?[.][A][OpenLeft][LoadFace][0x122][OpenLeft]We all made it. It's so smoky that

You have no right to drag me across[.]
creation without any pay whatsoever![A][OpenMidRight]Is this about wages? I believe you've[.]

that word means?[A]
You're the princess of Rausten! I thought[.]
working for you would pay well.[.][A]
Yet your purse strings are knotted tight,[.]

You don't have to bother her.[.][A]
Actually I wanted to ask you something.[.]
How would you like to hire me?[A]
The name's Rennac. I'm a world-class thief,[.]

Lockpicks are for amateurs. I can pick

[OpenMidRight]I'm afraid I only have[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]Oh, oh[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]I see.[A]

figure you for having money problems.[.][A]
Such is life, eh? Come back and see[.]
me when you've raised the gold.[.][A]
[0A9B]
[OpenMidRight]Should I hire him?
[Yes]
[0A9C]
[OpenMidRight]Fine. I'll pay the 9,980 gold.[A][OpenMidLeft]Very good! You know a bargain[.]
when you see one, don't you?[A]
Not at all like a certain pious[.]
princess I know.[A][OpenMidRight]Were you speaking of L'Arachel?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Uh, no[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]Idle chitchat about that
lass is bound to land me in hot water.[A]
Right, then! You're my new boss.[A]
Point out any doors or chests, and
get out of my way![A]
[0A9D]
[OpenMidRight]After a moment's thought[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
There's no way you can be worth[.]

drown in chaos, and we gain nothing![A]
Why do you wage this war? What is it you
hope to achieve?[A]
You've sent our men to fight and die for
nothing! This isn't war[.][ToggleMouthMove]--[ToggleMouthMove]it's murder![A][OpenRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]Duessel.[A]
This decision is ours to make.[A]
You have no voice in these matters.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Punish me if you must, Your Majesty,
but I implore you![A]
Please rethink this!! If this[.]
continues, Grado will[.][ToggleMouthMove]--[ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenRight]Duessel.[A]
Go to Frelia.[.][A]
Crush the Frelian army and he[.]
who leads them, Prince Ephraim.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Your Majesty![.][A][OpenRight]Have you gone deaf?[.][A][Clear]
Duessel.[A]
Go to Frelia.[.][A]
Crush the Frelian army and he[.]

snooping about outside.[.][A][OpenMidRight][ClearFace][OpenRight][LoadFace][0x12C][OpenFarRight][LoadFace][0x16B][OpenRight][MoveRight][OpenRight]Let me go! Stop it![.]
That hurts![.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Ooooh[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
You didn't tell me she was
such a treat for the eyes.[A]
Heh heh[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
This is a prize worth catching.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenRight]I-I came for Ephraim.[.][A]
If you do anything to me,[.]
he will not be merciful.[A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Heh heh[.][ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]I like her.[.]
Throw her in a cell.[A]
I'll spend the evening giving[.]
her a thorough interrogation.[.][A]

[0AA3]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x114][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x104][OpenMidRight]That is Fort Rigwald.[.][A]
It has stood unconquered for generations.[.]
Its defenses are legendary.[.][A]
It is the jewel of Grado's fortifications,
and its walls have never been breached.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]And if we don't capture it, any attack
on the capital will be pointless.[.][A]
Tell me what you see, Seth.[.]
Do we have the power to take it?[A][OpenMidRight]It's a daunting task.[.][A]
The enemy has the advantage of
both terrain and numbers.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]But what about in morale?[.][A][OpenMidRight]Do you suspect the soldiers[.]
may be unwilling to fight?[A][OpenMidLeft]Anything's possible.[A]
This war is a sudden thing, but Grado[.]
and Renais had long been friendly.[A]
Before these hostilities, our nations were
allies[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]No, closer even than that.[A]
This is the emperor's war, but the hearts[.]
of the people are not so swift to change.[.][A][Clear]
For example, General Duessel, one of the
Imperial Three they call Obsidian[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
He was the one who taught me what I[.]
know about fighting with the lance.[.][A]
Duessel's sympathies are sure to remain[.]
with Renais[.][ToggleMouthMove]--[ToggleMouthMove]and with our cause.[.][A]
He is loyal to Grado, but he has no love
of war. I'm sure he will speak with me.[.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]And more than that, Prince Lyon[.]
has been my friend for years.[.][A]
He can be timid at times and perhaps
was unable to oppose his father in this.[A]
But I'm sure he detests this fighting[.]
and shares my opinions.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Prince Ephraim[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]There must be some Grado soldiers within
the castle who do not want to fight.[A]
If we can rush the fort and seize the[.]
throne room, I believe they will surrender.[.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]Optimism here may be deadly.[A]
Still, it's a far better plan than
challenging the main army face-to-face.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Eirika is on her way to Rausten[.]
to help end this conflict.[A]
We cannot afford to wait here[.]
for much longer.[A]
We must take this fort and then[.]
press on to the capital itself.[.][A]
Let's go![.][A]
[0AA4]
[OpenFarFarLeft][LoadFace][0x16D][OpenRight][LoadFace][0x16B][OpenFarFarLeft]Attack! We're under attack![.]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]Looks to be Frelian troops.[.][A]
Their commander is[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
Prince Ephraim of Renais![.][A][OpenRight]Renais? This whole thing stinks.[A]
My younger sister and her husband[.]
were living in Renais[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][CloseSpeechSlow][OpenRight]What is the emperor thinking,[.]
starting this war? I think[ToggleMouthMove]--[ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenFarFarRight][LoadFace][0x13D][OpenFarFarRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]Hey.[A][OpenRight]Ah![.][A]
[0AA5]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x16B][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x13D][OpenMidRight]Yeah, I heard you. Talking
about not fighting, are you?[A]
Losing your nerve?[A]
The punishment for treason is[.]
harsh. You'll burn at the stake.[A][OpenMidLeft]B-but[.][ToggleMouthMove]--[ToggleMouthMove][A]
It's not just me! Even General
Duessel is opposed to this war![.][A][OpenMidRight]Duessel? You'd side with that[.]
washed-up coward?[.][A]
And who is your commanding
officer? Is it Duessel?[.][A]
Come on, out with it![.][A][OpenMidLeft]Y-you are, Sir Gheb.[A][OpenMidRight]That's right. So that should make it
clear whose orders you follow, eh?[A][Clear]
You got that, dolts? If you do,[.]
then shut up and get in formation.[A]
No one cares whether you minnows
live or die anyway. Got it?[.][A]
[0AA6]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x119][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x13D][OpenMidLeft][MoveMidLeft][OpenMidLeft]W-wait a moment![A]
That's a horrible[.]
thing to say![.][A][OpenMidRight]And who are you supposed to be?[.][A]
Your name! Out with it![.][A][OpenMidLeft]I-I'm Amelia[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
I was assigned to this
fort today![.][A]
I am a soldier of Grado.
I am not a slave![.][A][OpenMidRight][MoveRight][OpenRight][ToggleSmile]What's this now?
You're a girl?[A]
You've got a lot of nerve talking[.]
like that to your commander, recruit.[.][A]
Looks like I'm going to have to teach[.]
you about the chain of command.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft][MoveFarLeft][OpenFarLeft]Ah[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenFarFarRight][LoadFace][0x16B][OpenFarFarRight][MoveFarRight][OpenFarRight]Commander Gheb![.]
Enemy troops approaching![.][A][OpenRight]Grrr! Stinking interruptions[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
Form up, you useless worms. Don't[.]
let those dogs near the throne.[.][A][Clear]
Grado cannot afford to lose a[.]
brilliant tactician of my stature![A]
No one will blink if any of you[.]
worthless toads dies. But if I die[ToggleMouthMove]--[ToggleMouthMove][A]
You should be happy to fight, kill,[.]
and die in my service![A]
[0AA7]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x119][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x16B][OpenMidRight]I became a soldier to honor the emperor,
General Duessel, and the people of Grado.[.][A]
But this[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]this is wrong![A][OpenMidLeft]That's the lot of a soldier. We're pawns
in the games of kings and emperors.[.][A]
We fight as ordered, and we die as
ordered. That's it.[.][A]
C'mon, time to go.[A]
[0AA8]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x12C][OpenMidRight]Oh, what a fool I've been[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
I came all this way to help Ephraim,
and I end up getting captured again.[A][Clear]
That General Gheb had the creepiest[.]
eyes[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]and that laugh! Oh![.][A]
Hurry, Ephraim[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]Please.[.]
Hurry and rescue me.[A]
[0AA9]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x13D][OpenMidLeft]Y-you wench[.][ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]You're that[.]

Do you think you can betray[.]
me and get away with it?[A][OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x119][OpenMidRight]Your threats no longer
hold any power over me.[.][A]
I-I am not your pawn![.][A][OpenMidRight][ClearFace]

[0AAC]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x114][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x104][OpenMidRight]Prince Ephraim, the rest of the[.]
enemy troops have been routed.[A][OpenMidLeft]Bring me one of the prisoners.
I have a question I need answered.[A]
[0AAD]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x114][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x16B][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]I'm going to ask you a question. If[.]
you've no wish to answer, remain silent.[A]
If you wish this conflict to end quickly,[.]
however, you will cooperate.[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]What do you want?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Why has Grado invaded Renais?[.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]I can't say.[A]
This war began on the[.]
emperor's orders.[.][A]
Soldiers like me haven't the
foggiest idea what he's after.[A][OpenMidLeft]Then tell me this:
where is General Duessel?[.][A][OpenMidRight]In the capital. The general's been
opposed to this war from the start.[.][A]
He's been pleading with the emperor for[.]
days now, but the emperor ignores him.[A]
They say some are questioning the[.]
general's loyalty.[A]
He's putting his standing[.][ToggleMouthMove]--[ToggleMouthMove]and his life[ToggleMouthMove]--[ToggleMouthMove]
in danger by being so vocal.[A][OpenMidLeft]Is that so[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
Well, it appears General Duessel remains
the same true man I knew before.[A][CloseSpeechSlow][OpenMidLeft]What about Prince Lyon? Where's[.]
he been through all of this?[A]
Why didn't he do anything to
temper his father's aggression?[.][A][LoadOverworldFaces][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A][Clear]
According to rumors[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
Emperor Vigarde was convinced to start this[.]
war by none other than the prince himself.[A][LoadOverworldFaces][OpenMidLeft]What did you say?[.][A][Clear]
That's ridiculous![A]
I know Prince Lyon well. No one[.]
hates fighting more than he does.[.][A]
He would never do anything to[.]
trigger all this bloodshed![.][A][OpenMidRight][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x104][OpenMidRight]Prince Ephraim, please calm down.[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]I'm sorry.[A]
[0AAE]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x114][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x104][OpenMidLeft]We leave the prisoners and the
fort to the Frelian troops.[.][A]
Seth, I intend for us to press
on toward the capital.[A]
At some point, I expect we'll[.]
find either Duessel or Lyon.[A]
I'm sure we can convince them to
join us in stopping Emperor Vigarde.[A][OpenMidRight]Understood. But I have
misgivings, my prince.[A]
General Duessel and Prince Lyon[.]
are both men of Grado.[A]
If we are forced into conflict
with them[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]It won't happen.[A]
Duessel was my teacher, and I know
he is a man of character.[.][A]
And I've known Lyon since we were children.[.]
He, Eirika, and I are old friends.[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]I understand your concerns.[.][A][Clear]
If worse comes to worst and steel[.]
is drawn, I will not hesitate.[A]
I'll fight and kill anyone who
thinks to oppose me.[A][Clear]
Are you satisfied, Seth?[A][OpenMidRight]Yes[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
I apologize for my rudeness.[A]
Your father is gone, and that[.]
means you are king of Renais.[.][A]
There is no other.[A]
I just ask that you not throw[.]
yourself into needless danger.[A][OpenMidLeft]I hear you.[.][A]
The decisions I make affect[.]
more than my own life.[A]
Once this war is finished, I will[.]
rebuild Renais with Eirika.[.][A]
That is my mission.[.][A]
[0AAF]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x114][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x126][OpenMidLeft]Myrrh.[A][OpenMidRight]What is it?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]You must return to Frelia.[A]

No. I want to[.]
stay with you[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]No, Myrrh.[A]
I'm continuing on to the Grado capital.[.]
It's going to be very dangerous.[A]
I can't protect you[.][ToggleMouthMove]--[ToggleMouthMove]not as well as
I'd like to, anyway.[A][OpenMidRight]Everything comes from that direction.[.][A]
I can feel my lost dragonstone[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]

The dark energy still flows unchecked[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][Clear]
I cannot go home while it[.]

cannot refuse you anything.[.][A]
Your eyes remind me too[.]
much of Eirika.[.][A]

Take a battalion and follow him.[A][OpenMidRight]Understood. When I arrive, I will[.]
place my troops at his disposal.[A][OpenMidLeft]No[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]You will not.[.][A]
You will strike[.]
Duessel down.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Wha[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]Duessel is a traitor.[.][A]
He has abandoned his country
and sided with Renais.[A]
The punishment for treason
is death.[.][A][OpenMidRight]B-but[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
General Duessel a traitor?
That's just not possible![.][A]
There must be a mistake[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]No[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]I did not mean that you[.]
are mistaken, Your Majesty.[.][A]

You will execute Duessel.[.][A][OpenMidRight][CloseEyes][......][OpenMidRight][OpenEyes][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]Your Majesty.[.][A]
Will you allow me[.]
to ask you a question?[A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]When Your Majesty saw fit to
make me a general,[A]
you shared with me some words of wisdom.
I remember the moment quite clearly.[A]
You told me the role of an imperial general[.]
is that of the shield, not the blade.[.][A]
We are here to protect our citizens, you
said[ToggleMouthMove]--[ToggleMouthMove]not to threaten our neighbors.[A]
I have never forgotten your words,
Your Majesty.[.][A]
I have held them to my breast. They[.]
govern my every action as general.[A]
Your Majesty, that sentiment
is still alive, and[.][ToggleMouthMove]--[ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]Go.[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
I humbly acknowledge your orders.[.]
Your Majesty[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][Clear]
I am the empire's servant.
I am Your Majesty's vassal.[.][A]
I am General Selena, the
Fluorspar of the Grado Empire.[A]

It's not surprising you fell

Can you get up?[.][A][OpenMidRight]Sh-shut up![.][A][OpenLeft]Did you hurt your knee?[.][A]
I know how it feels. I did it[.]
often enough as a recruit myself.[.][A]
To be honest, I still do it[.]
more than I should.[.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenLeft]I'm Franz. I'm a Knight of Renais.
What's your name?[.][A][OpenMidRight]I'm Amelia.[.][A][OpenLeft]Amelia, do you think I could
ask you to surrender?[.][A]
This may be odd, but I really[.]
have no desire to fight you.[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenLeft]I get the feeling you don't want
to fight either. Am I right?[A][OpenMidRight]I[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
B-but[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
I've heard Prince Ephraim takes female
prisoners and uses them as palace slaves.[.][A]
If I surrender, will I be forced to[.]
work in the palace, too?[A][OpenLeft]N-no, don't be silly![.][A]
Prince Ephraim would never do such a
thing[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][....]I think[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]You think?[A][OpenLeft]No, he wouldn't! Of course not.[.]

I'm a soldier of Grado, and I will
defeat every soldier of Frelia I meet![A][OpenMidLeft]Is that so?[.][A]
Guess I'm ready then.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Um[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]Is that the stance you're going to
use? You'll drop your lance that way.[.][A]
I'm Prince Ephraim of Renais. Why don't[.]
you surrender and come with me?[.][A][OpenMidRight]Wha-what are you going to do to me?![A][OpenMidLeft]Calm down.[A]
As long as you don't try to stab me,

I am not going to hurt you. If you're scared,[.]
throw down your weapon and run away.[A]

helping you in some way.[A]
But while I was looking for[.]
you, I got captured by Grado troops.[A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Is that so? Well, I'm glad
to see you're unharmed.[.][A]
Tana, you should head back

King Hayden must be worried[.]

But I've been so worried about
you, Ephraim![.][A][OpenMidLeft]I see. Oh, please don't look at me

If you're really determined to help,
then you're welcome to come with us.[A]

anything reckless.[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Ephraim[.][ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]Thank you.[A]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x114][OpenRight][LoadFace][0x169][OpenRight]Please wait, Prince Ephraim.
I have a message from Frelia.[.][A]
There's been an uprising in Carcino.[A]
Pablo is leading a force of renegade
Grado supporters in rebellion.[A][OpenMidLeft]In Carcino[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
Any word of Eirika?[.]

Eirika heading to assist Prince Innes.[A]
We've not heard from her since.[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]Blast.[A]
I sent Eirika to Rausten thinking[.]
it would be the safest mission.[.][A]

Was that an earthquake?[.][A]
I think it's passed.[A][OpenRight][LoadFace][0x104][OpenRight]Prince Ephraim.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]I'm fine. There's nothing to worry about.[.][A]
I was surprised, that's all. You're not[.]
shaken in the slightest, are you?[.][A][OpenRight]Actually, it surprised me as well.[A]
I'd heard that tremors such as those
were commonplace in Grado.[A]
Apparently, they are usually weak and[.]
cause little, if any, damage.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Now that you mention it, I remember a[.]
while back, when I was first in Grado.[A]
Eirika and I were startled by a[.]
tremor just like that one.[A]
Lyon said he had grown used to them,
and he just laughed.[A][OpenRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]We don't have any time to tend
to injuries just now.[.][A]
We must press forward. We must
see to the capital.[.][A]
[0AB6]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x125][OpenMidLeft]I do not understand[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]

Frelia's army will be coming

We're just waiting for the

the enemy forces, doesn't he?[.][A][OpenMidRight]That is correct.
Prince Ephraim of Renais.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Bah[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]Renais is our enemy.[A]

Do not initiate the attack.[.][A]
I want to speak with Ephraim first.[.][A][LoadOverworldFaces][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
So it's true.[.][A]
You plan to betray the empire and[.]
ally yourself with the enemy.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]What?![A][LoadOverworldFaces][OpenMidRight]General Duessel, you stand accused
of treason of the highest order.[A]
Lay down your weapons, and follow[.]
my commands.[A]
If you fail to do so, if you resist in
any way, I will execute you on the spot.[A][OpenMidLeft]This is nonsense![.][A]
Who is behind this madness![.][A][OpenMidRight]These are His Majesty's orders.[.][A]
The emperor has anticipated[.]
your treachery.[.][A][Clear]
Prepare yourself.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Impossible[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]His Majesty?[A]
[0AB7]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x13F][OpenRight][LoadFace][0x113][OpenMidLeft]Cormag, you and I will
bring that traitor down.[A]
Go around that fort to the southeast
and drive into them from the sea.[.][A][OpenRight]We're fighting General Duessel?[.][A]
But he's one of the cornerstones
of the empire. How could[ToggleMouthMove]--[ToggleMouthMove][A]
He's been like a father to you
and to my brother.[A]
Do you truly mean to kill him?[A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
If that is what my emperor commands,
then yes. Without hesitation.[.][A]
Cormag, if you are a true knight
of Grado, you will do the same.[.][A][OpenRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[0AB8]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x114][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x104][OpenMidRight]Prince Ephraim, the Imperial
Grado army is before us.[A][OpenMidLeft]I know, but something's odd.[A]
They're chasing someone down.[.]
Is that a deserter?[.][A][Clear]
Wait![.]
That's[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]Duessel?![.][A][OpenMidRight]Prince Ephraim, your orders.[A][OpenMidLeft]We rescue Duessel!
Ride!!![.][A]
[0AB9]
[OpenRight][LoadFace][0x142][SendToBack][OpenRight]What's this? They've only just begun?[.]
What a disappointment.[A]
I so wanted to witness the comedy of two
generals hacking away at each other.[A][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x13F][OpenMidLeft]Valter[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
What do you want?[.][A][OpenRight]Ah, Selena. You're to return to the[.]
capital immediately.[A]
Duessel is no longer your concern.[A]
His Majesty has declared you untrustworthy.[.]
I've been sent to relieve you of command.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]What?[.][A][OpenRight]You've proven yourself incapable of dealing[.]
with a single old man[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
I tell you, having to clean up your mess
makes things difficult for me, Selena.[A]
Now then, Beran.[A][OpenFarRight][LoadFace][0x13E][OpenFarRight]Yes, sir.[.][A][OpenRight]I'm leaving.[A]
I can't leave poor Eirika sad[.]
and lonely in Carcino.[A]
You're in command here for the
duration of this conflict.[A][OpenFarRight]I'll take care of things.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]What do you think you're doing?![A]
I am here at His Majesty's bidding,[.]
and[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenRight]Did you not hear me? His Majesty's
bidding has CHANGED.[A]
You, Selena, are not to be trusted.[.]
These are His Majesty's words.[A]
You share the same sentiments as Duessel.[.]
You could turn traitor, just as he has.[.][A]
You should feel honored. He could have
ordered me to kill you where you stand.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Th-that's absurd![.][A]
His Majesty, he[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
He knows I am trustworthy.[A][OpenRight]Then return to the capital
and sort it out.[A]
Go and ask your beloved master
whether I speak the truth.[A][OpenMidLeft]I[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenRight]What are you going to do, Selena?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]I will return to the capital.[.][A]
I know better than to trust your word.
I will speak with the emperor myself.[.][A]
[0ABA]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x142][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x13E][OpenMidRight]Heh heh[.][ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]Stupid woman.[.][A]
If Grado wins too easily,[.]
there'll be no more bloodshed.[A]
We must do what we can
to extend the fun[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][Clear]
I believe it's time for me to[.]
return to my darling Eirika.[A]
It wouldn't do for Glen to
arrive before me, would it?[.][A]
Take care of things here before[.]
I return to you. Understood?[A][OpenMidLeft]Of course.[A]
[0ABB]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x113][OpenMidRight]Tell me, Brother, what should I do?[.][A]
[0ABC]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x113][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x16B][OpenMidLeft]Commander Cormag![.][A][OpenMidRight]I know what I must do.[A]
I'm a sworn knight of Grado,
and I have a duty to fulfill.[.][A]
Let's start by putting an end[.]
to that Frelian army. Move out![.][A]
[0ABD]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x125][OpenMidRight]Cormag[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
So, you've been sent to[.]
bring me in as well?[A][OpenMidRight][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x113][OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x125][OpenMidRight]There's no point in hesitating.[.]
You must stop me.[.][A]
After all, those are His
Majesty's orders.[.][A][OpenMidRight][ClearFace]
[0ABE]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x13E][OpenMidLeft]Prince Ephraim of Renais[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
The Obsidian Duessel[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
Two incredible trophies.
Who could ask for more?[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ClearFace]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x13E][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x16B][OpenMidLeft]Grrr[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]They've held on for[.]
too long.[.][A]
If this continues, General
Valter will have me[.][ToggleMouthMove]--[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]Prepare a ship. We
must flee. Quickly![.][A][OpenMidRight]B-but General Valter[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
He'll be so angry[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]We're doomed either way.[A]
General Valter will never[.]
forgive our failure here[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
And if we stay, we'll be devoured[.]
like those other fools[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
Our best bet is to give up
and escape with our lives.[A][OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidRight]Commander Beran! Wait![A]
[0AC1]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x114][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x104][OpenMidRight]Prince Ephraim. The remaining[.]
enemy troops have fled.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]I see. And what of Duessel?[.]
Is he unharmed?[.][A][OpenMidRight]Yes. This way.[A]
[0AC2]
[OpenLeft][LoadFace][0x114][OpenFarLeft][LoadFace][0x126][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x125][SendToBack][OpenMidRight]Prince Ephraim[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
You've grown to be quite
the impressive commander.[.][A]
I remember what a stubborn young
lad you were when I taught you.[.][A][OpenLeft]Any skill I have, I owe[.]
to you, Duessel.[A]
I'm curious, why are you being
pursued by your own troops?[.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A][LoadOverworldFaces][OpenLeft]Speak to me, Duessel.[.][A]
I want to put an end to this war.[.][A]
I'm sure you feel the same way.[.][A][LoadOverworldFaces][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]As you know, the emperor
was once a man of compassion.[.][A]
He loathed war, and he worked to
build peace across all nations.[.][A]
Then[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]one day that all changed.[.][A][OpenLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
But why? Why did he change?[.]
What happened?[A][OpenMidRight]I wish I knew.[A]
But if you're looking for a[.]
likely cause, I have one.[.][A]
This all seems to have begun
when Prince Lyon and the mages[A]
created a strange gemstone they[.]
referred to as the Dark Stone.[A][OpenLeft]The Dark Stone?[.][A][OpenMidRight]That's what the clerics and the prince
called it, at any rate.[.][A]
Now, I'm just a soldier. I don't know[.]
anything about these magic things.[A]
But they said the Dark Stone is more
powerful even than the Sacred Stones.[.][A][OpenLeft]And the Sacred Stones had the power[.]
to defeat the Demon King.[.][A]
If the Dark Stone is stronger than
they are[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenFarLeft][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]Ephraim.[A][OpenLeft]What is it, Myrrh?[A][OpenFarLeft]The wave of evil I felt[.]
surging from the capital[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
It hungers[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]It consumes.
It envelops and transforms.[.][A]
This power can tarnish the purest[.]
of souls with its corruption.[.][A][OpenLeft]Are you saying this Dark Stone is[.]
responsible for the change in Vigarde?[A]
The timing fits, doesn't it? The
stone is created, and then[ToggleMouthMove]--[ToggleMouthMove][A]
Duessel, where is the Dark Stone now?[.][A][OpenMidRight]It's in the capital, with Prince Lyon.[A]
He's been carrying it with him ever[.]
since the day it was created.[.][A][OpenLeft]Understood. Duessel, I'm going
to the capital.[.][A]
I must talk to Lyon. Maybe we[.]
can restore the emperor together.[.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]I'm going with you.[.][A][OpenLeft]But we'll be fighting Grado's[.]
army[ToggleMouthMove]--[ToggleMouthMove]your own men.[.][A][OpenMidRight]I appreciate your concern, but I've[.]
already been branded a traitor.[.][A]
Prince Ephraim, if you mean to
save my lord the emperor[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
If you hope to restore him to[.]
his former self[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
then I will pledge my loyalty[.]
to you until your cause is won.[.][A][CloseSpeechSlow]
[0AC3]
[OpenLeft][ClearFace][OpenFarLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x16F][OpenMidLeft]General Duessel![A][OpenMidRight]Men, I owe each of you
an apology.[.][A]
You've served me well,
and I have betrayed you.[A][OpenMidLeft]You speak nonsense, General![A]
We are your men, no matter
what happens![.][A]
If you must leave Grado to
fight with Frelia's men,[A]
then our place is at your side.[.]
Your road is our road![A][OpenMidRight]My brave men[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[ToggleSmile]Sniff[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
Bah, I'm getting old.[.][A]
I'm a sentimental old fool.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]We ask to be allowed to[.]
join the Frelian army.[A]
Prince Ephraim has many soldiers.[.]
He doesn't need us with him.[A]
Please, send us older soldiers
off to fight with Frelia.[.][A]
And may the gods of war smile[.]
upon you, General Duessel.[A]
[0AC4]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x114][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x104][OpenMidRight]Prince Ephraim, we must now[.]
take to the seas.[.][A]
The Frelian army is readying
a ship for us now.[A]
We have some time to rest[.]
until it's ready to set sail.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Right. We'll take a break,
then. Tell the men.[.][A]
The road ahead is bound[.]
to be a rough one.[A]
[0AC5]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x114][OpenRight][LoadFace][0x122][OpenRight]Well, hello there![A]
Tell me, are you all
waiting to board a ship?[A][OpenMidLeft]Er, yes, we are[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenRight]I recommend that you abandon
your plans, my friends.[.][A]
The locals are too frightened[.]
to set sail upon these seas.[A][OpenMidLeft]Is there a storm coming in?[.][A][OpenRight]No, no storm[ToggleMouthMove]--[ToggleMouthMove]demons.[.][A]
Some sort of phantom ship[.]
commands these seas now.[A][OpenMidLeft]A phantom ship?[.][A][OpenRight]Yes. But you needn't worry
for long, my friends.[.][A]
I plan on purging the seas
of that pesky ghost ship.[.][A][OpenFarRight][LoadFace][0x124][OpenFarRight]Oh, no[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]Here we go again.[.][A][OpenFarRight][ClearFace][OpenFarRight][LoadFace][0x123][OpenFarRight][ToggleSmile]Gwah ha ha![.]
Well said, Princess L'Arachel![A][ToggleSmile][OpenRight]I, L'Arachel, am destined to become[.]
the protector of the seas![A]
Fare thee well, strangers.[.....]
Come, Dozla, we must find a ship.[.][A][OpenRight][ClearFace][OpenFarRight][ToggleSmile]Gwah ha ha! Sounds fun![.]
Come on, Rennac![A][ToggleSmile][OpenFarRight][ClearFace][OpenFarRight][LoadFace][0x124][OpenFarRight]Honestly, L'Arachel, do you even
think before you set these plans?[.][A]
Oh, please[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]Someone end[.]
my misery![A][OpenFarRight][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]What was all that about?[A]
[0AC6]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x114][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x104][OpenMidRight]Prince Ephraim, our[.]
ship has arrived.[.][A]
Let us prepare to board.
[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]Something troubling you?[A][OpenMidLeft]No[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]It's nothing.[.][A][Clear]
All right. Here we go![A]
[0AC7]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x114][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x125][OpenMidLeft]Duessel![A][OpenMidRight]Is that you, Prince Ephraim?[A][OpenMidLeft]Why were those Grado men after you?[.]
What's going on?[A]
Wait, we can talk later. Let's get
you to safety first.[A]
Come with us, Duessel.[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]Duessel![A][OpenMidRight]I am General Duessel, the Obsidian,[.]
of the Imperial Three[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
This name and my service to His Majesty[.]
have been my life's blood.[A]
As of this moment it is all gone.[.]
I've no reason to continue[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]Duessel[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
Enough of this rubbish![.][A]
You are my mentor! I will[.]
not let you die![A][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]Prince Ephraim.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]I know about the
emperor's madness.[A]
How will your death serve[.]
Grado? Who will it help?[A]
What of your country? Its[.]
people? Its future!?[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]You will live, Duessel.[.][A]
As a traitor[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
In disgrace[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
I know that for a man such as you[.]
this is more agonizing than death.[A]
But you will live nonetheless. You
will live for something more important.[.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
I understand.[.][A]
This old fool's[.]
life is yours.[A]
[0AC8]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x125][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x113][OpenMidLeft]Is that you, Cormag?[A][OpenMidRight]Sir Duessel[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
You have abandoned your country and[.]
your lord. I must take your life.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]I know. I'm ready now.[A]
I have no duty anymore. But you, Cormag.
You're a soldier of the empire.[.][A]
Follow your orders and fulfill your[.]
mission. I'm ready.[.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]Cormag![.][A][OpenMidRight]To be honest, I'm confused.[.][A]
Must you truly die? Is your[.]
crime really deserving of death?[A]
I know my brother could have
settled this, but[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
I've come here to stop you, and[.]
yet I find that I cannot.[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]You see, I couldn't believe you[.]
would ever truly turn traitor.[A]
And now I stand here, looking at
you, Duessel of the Imperial Three.[.][A]
And you do not have the eyes of[.]
a traitor.[A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]No. I cannot turn my lance on[.]
you, the empire's faithful son.[.][A]
General Duessel[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
Until this matter is sorted, you
travel under my protection.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Cormag[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
Forgive me[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[0AC9]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x12C][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x113][OpenMidLeft]Wait.[.][A]
Please stop fighting.[.][A]
I'm sure we can reach an
agreement if we just talk.[A][OpenMidRight]You are[.][ToggleMouthMove]...?[ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]My name is Tana. You're from
Grado, aren't you?[A]
Why are you fighting
against General Duessel?[A][OpenMidRight]That's none of your[.][ToggleMouthMove]--[ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]Do you hate him?[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]Do I hate him? This isn't some petty
schoolyard squabble, girl.[A]
I'm a soldier of the empire, and
I have my orders.[.][A]
I've been sent to punish a traitor,[.]
and that's what I aim to do.[A][OpenMidLeft]Are you telling me that[.]
General Duessel's a traitor?[A]
Don't you know him? Do you
think that's really true?[.][A][OpenMidRight]What I think isn't at question.[.]
Faith does not dictate my actions.[A]
I have my orders.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Ephraim trusts your General Duessel.
He's given him the benefit of the doubt.[A]
Have you chosen not to believe the
reasons for his actions?[A][OpenMidRight]Get out of my way![A]
I'll waste no more time[.]
with this duel of words![A][OpenMidLeft]Wait![.]
Please[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
Protect General Duessel.[A]
It would be tragic if he died[.]
before his motives became clear.[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]Move, please.[.][A]
If you won't get out of the way,
I'll have to move you by force.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Very well. If you must.[.][A]
But in exchange, I'm asking you[.]
to believe General Duessel.[.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]You're an odd bird.[.][A]
To think I'd lose a fight not to a
man's sword but to a woman's words[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]What?[.][A][OpenMidRight]You win.
I will protect General Duessel.[.][A]
But I plan on sorting this whole
mess out with the general himself.[A][OpenMidLeft]Do you mean that?[.][A][OpenMidRight]I don't know if this is the[.]
right thing to do or not.[.][A]
But I think this is what my[.]
brother would have done.[A]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x159][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0xFFFF][OpenMidLeft]This area of the ocean is often[.]
blanketed in a thick fog.[.][A]

Oh, yes[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
And there's this.[.][A]
This torch staff shines just as bright

it, it's just so much extra baggage.[A]

Now, I shall purge the seas of this[.]
vile vessel of villainy![A][OpenFarRight]Gwah ha ha! Nice alliteration,
Princess L'Arachel![.][A][OpenRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A][Clear]
Hm? I didn't hear Rennac's voice.[.]
How very odd.[.][A]
Dozla, where has Rennac run off[.]
to this time?[.][A][OpenFarRight]Hmmm[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]He was with us at mealtime
before we boarded, but[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenRight]That man can be such a distraction.[.]

Let's get started destroying
these agents of chaos![A][OpenFarRight][MoveFarRight][OpenFarRight]Gwah ha ha![.]

evil in the name of virtue and order.[.][A][ToggleSmile][CloseSpeechSlow][OpenMidRight]Wait[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]Your face has a[.]
certain familiarity.[A]
I recently met a young woman
who greatly resembles you.[A][OpenMidLeft]Do you mean, Eirika?
She's my sister.[A][OpenMidRight]Eirika?[.][A]
Isn't that the name of the
princess of Renais?[.][A]
And you have a very regal air[.]
about you yourself, don't you?[A][OpenMidLeft]My name is Ephraim, Prince of Renais.[.]
We're fighting to end Grado's invasion.[.][A]
To be honest[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[0AD7]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x114][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x122][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Oh my![A]
In that case, I 
must accompany you.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Do you understand that we alone[.]
are facing all the armies of Grado?[.][A]
We face untold numbers, and our odds
of success are embarrassingly small.[A][OpenMidRight]You clearly do not know who I am.[.][A]
Do not be startled by what I'm
about to disclose to you[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
I am the princess of Rausten,[.]
theocracy of the righteous![.][A][OpenMidLeft]You're the princess of Rausten?[.][A]
Hm. You certainly don't have the
bearing of a commoner, but[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight][MoveMidRight][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Ah, of course. My natural nobility
gives me away every time.[.][A]
Truth to tell, dire circumstances have
led me to begin this journey in secret.[.][A][Clear]
Prince Ephraim of Renais, please be[.]

Let us stand together against the[.]
villainous Grado Empire![A][ToggleSmile][CloseSpeechSlow]

We will now be traveling with[.]
Ephraim and his companions.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Gwah ha ha![.]

For you, Princess L'Arachel, I would
dive headlong into a sea of evil![.][A]
Why, I'd even tie myself up with ropes
and chains first![.][A][OpenMidRight]Such fabulous devotion! You are[.]
truly my most loyal attendant.[A]
Let us be off then.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Gwah ha ha![.][A]

I just feel a bit like being
alone and weeping for a while.[A][OpenMidLeft]What? No, you can't[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
This is no place for crying.[A]
I'm sure you've noticed, but
we're under attack by monsters.[.][A]
If you can do anything to help,[.]
we would appreciate it.[.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]That's a good idea! I'll do it.[.][A]

Ready as always![A]
[0ADB]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x114][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x104][OpenMidRight]Prince Ephraim, we've[.]
docked in Taizel.[.][A]
There's no sign of enemy
troops at this time.[A][OpenMidLeft]Understood. Let's move quickly and prepare
to go ashore.[.][A]
We've a straight road to the capital from[.]

fiercer as we near the capital.[.][A]
If I may, my lord, I'd like to make[.]
a suggestion.[.][A]
[0ADC]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x120][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x121][OpenMidRight]This is the town, isn't it, Ewan?[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yep. Thanks a lot, Teacher.[.][A]
This is where Marisa is supposed to be.[.][A]
I have to tell her what's going on,[.]
or she'll end up working for free.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]What happened? I heard there
was some mistake, but[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]Yeah, the mercenary guild got Marisa
mixed up with someone else.[.][A]
I don't know where she was supposed[.]
to go, but they sent her here instead.[A]
I figured I'd better let her know[.]
about the mix-up, right?[A]
So what are you going to do now?[A][OpenMidRight]I'm heading back to the village.[A]
I've looked near and far, but I haven't[.]
been able to locate the Lord Dragon.[A]
I must report my findings.[A][OpenMidLeft]Oh, I see[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]I'll be going now. Remember[.]
what I told you, Ewan[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft][MoveMidLeft][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I know, I know. Don't[.]
be reckless with magic.[.][A][ToggleSmile]
[0ADD]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x121][OpenMidLeft]Well, I'd better get going

That looks like a good place
to start asking around.[.][A]

From the east[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenFarFarLeft][MoveFarLeft][OpenLeft][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]That won't do, Seth.[A]
I cannot approve of sending[.]
reservists to the front lines.[A][OpenMidRight]But[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]the Grado army outnumbers our own by a
tremendous amount.[A]
We have talented soldiers, but that counts
for nothing against those numbers.[A]
Currently, we have some ready reservists
in the rear, protecting our supply convoy.[A]
What good is defending our convoy if it[.]
comes at the cost of losing the front?[A]
We must abandon our rear guard and
strengthen the van, or we've already lost.[A][OpenLeft]This is enemy territory. We[.]
cannot surrender the convoy![A][OpenMidRight]But, Prince Ephraim[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenLeft]Seth, I know you only want to improve[.]
the odds of our success.[A]
And I know you make these suggestions[.]
in part to protect me from harm.[A]

[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x143][OpenMidRight]Soldiers of Grado! You call yourself
warriors? You're pathetic![A]
Fort Rigwald? You lost it! Your[.]
General Duessel? A traitor![.][A]
Where is the honor of the Grado Imperial
Army? It wallows in filth and mud![A]
Is this the ending you envisioned?
Is this how you would be remembered?[A]
Will you let the bards sing of how
you fell to the renegade Ephraim?[.][A][Clear]
I think not![A]
Now get up and fight![.]
Kill them all![A]
And bring me Ephraim's head![A]
[0AE1]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x143][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x148][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Heh heh heh[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[ToggleSmile]Caellach. Interesting.
What are you doing here?[A]
You were ordered to loose your dogs[.]
of war on Jehanna, were you not?[A][OpenMidLeft]Keep silent, you decrepit sod.
I told you, Jehanna's under control.[A]
My plan is in full effect.
All we need do now is wait.[.][A]
You see, Jehanna is an overripe fruit.[A]
It's being devoured by worms from within.[.]
We can pluck it anytime we wish.[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Heh heh heh[.][ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove][ToggleSmile]Oh, how your
plans seem to have gone awry.[.][A]
Even now, Eirika makes her
way toward Jehanna.[.][A]
Your perfect fruit has turned[.]
to rot while you did nothing.[.][A]
It's time. You will return to[.]
the capital with me.[A][OpenMidLeft]What?! Are you truly
serious, you old goat?[A]
Glen[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
No, it's that black-hearted Valter[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
What's he playing at now?[.][A][OpenMidRight]There's no call for that sort of talk.
That one has his uses after all.[A]
You can leave the defeat of Ephraim[.]
to your subordinates.[.][A]
Oh yes, and you can use the troops
I brought with me as well.[A]
It will, no doubt, be an interesting battle.
[ToggleSmile]Heh heh heh[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][Clear]
[ToggleSmile]Let's go now, Caellach.[.][A]
You wouldn't want to hurt a certain[.]
someone's feelings, would you?[A][OpenMidLeft]Bah.
What else can I do?[.][A]
[0AE2]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x114][OpenMidRight]More of those fiends?[.][A]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x114][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x104][OpenMidRight]The enemy troops have been defeated.
We're taking care of the wounded now.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Understood. We'll rest in this city until[.]
we're prepared to advance.[A]
Replenish supplies and rest the troops.[.][A]
Remind every soldier that anyone who breaks[.]
the city's laws will be severely punished.[A]
Anything else?[A][OpenMidRight]We should prepare defenses along
the east in case of assault.[A]
The capital's not far, and fresh
troops could be here at any time.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Good point. All right, set up[.]
three rotating watches. Then[ToggleMouthMove]--[ToggleMouthMove][A]

anyone see her?[.][A][OpenMidRight]One of the guards reports having seen[.]
a young lady heading east.[A]

feet. It may have been her.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Prepare to move out.
We head east.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Prince Ephraim[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][LoadOverworldFaces][OpenMidLeft]I'm not just acting on emotion, Seth.[.]

and sovereign, do you hear me?[A]
Listen, I know what you said is[.]
true. I am king in all but title now.[.][A]
I know I must place my duty as
commander above my life as a man.[.][A]
And once I am crowned, I most[.]
certainly will do exactly that.[.][A]
However, I am not ready to divorce
myself from my compassion just yet.[.][A]
I will find the balance somehow, the
means to save my country and her people.[A][Clear]
That is the king I wish to become,
and so that is the man I must be.[.][A]
I need your help in this, Seth.[.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]I understand, Prince Ephraim.[.][A]
If that is your decision, then I
will do my best to assist you.[A][OpenMidLeft]I'm counting on it.[.][A][CloseSpeechSlow][OpenMidLeft]Please be safe, Myrrh.[A]

His Majesty is most compassionate.[A][Clear]
You see, I'm a commoner. I was raised in
a desolate, impoverished village.[.][A]
My family couldn't afford our taxes.
No one could. We were desperate.[A]
Some of us considered[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]horrible things[.]
to make enough money to survive winter.[.][A]
Then, supplies began to arrive. We were[.]
told they came from the emperor himself.[A]
He sent them to us, a poor frontier town
who couldn't even afford to pay taxes.[A][OpenRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]Neighboring kingdoms must have thought
the emperor mad, I can only guess.[A]

his standing among kings.[.][A]

It's Selena Fluorspar.[A][OpenFarRight]Selena[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][.....] I've heard she wields
the power of the thunderstorm[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
that she uses its might to attack[.]
from afar without mercy.[A][OpenRight]Prince Ephraim, I urge you to exercise
caution when faced with such magic.[.][A]
[0AEE]
[OpenRight][LoadFace][0x11B][OpenFarRight][LoadFace][0x11C][OpenFarFarLeft][LoadFace][0x126][SendToBack][OpenRight]Prince Innes said they would
be around here somewhere.[.][A]
Now where in the blazes[.]
is this Ephraim?[A][OpenFarRight]From this distance, I can't tell
which army is Frelia and which Grado.[.][A]
We'll have to move in closer if[.]
we're to sort this all out.[.][A][OpenFarFarLeft][MoveMidLeft][OpenMidLeft]Ah[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenRight]Hm?[.][A][OpenFarRight]Oh, what an adorable girl.[A]
It's all right. Come here[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenRight]You're a bit young to be on your
own. Did you get lost then?[.][A][OpenMidLeft][MoveFarLeft][OpenFarLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenFarRight]There's no reason to be afraid.[.][A]
This fellow's a bit scary to
look at, but he's not so bad.[.][A][OpenRight]Come now[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]Hmph.[.]
But she is right, you know.[.][A]
If you keep looking so scared, you're[.]
likely to hurt my feelings.[.][A][OpenFarRight]Please, little one, tell us your name.[A][OpenFarLeft]I am Myrrh.[.][A]
I wish to return to Ephraim's side.[.][A][OpenRight]Ephraim?[A]
We're supposed to be guarding[.]
someone by that name[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
Can you help us find him?[.][A][OpenFarLeft]Yes[.][ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]He's over there.[A][OpenFarLeft][ClearFace][OpenRight]Hey! Hold on![.][A]
[0AEF]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x114][OpenFarFarRight][LoadFace][0x126][OpenFarFarRight][MoveMidRight][OpenMidRight]Ephraim.[A][OpenMidLeft]Myrrh! You're safe.[.]
Thank goodness.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Ephraim[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
I'm sorry.[A]
I[.][ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]I[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]Myrrh[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]It's because I forced you[.]
to bring me with you[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
I didn't want to be a[.]
burden to you any longer.[.][A]
But all I've done is made[.]
you worry[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
I'm[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]sorry[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]It's fine, Myrrh.[.][A]
I'm the one who should be sorry. I failed[.]
in my promise to watch over you.[A]
The battle's about to begin. I want you[.]
to move to the rear.[A][OpenMidRight]Ephraim[.][ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]Those aren't bad people.
I spoke to one, and she listened[ToggleMouthMove]--[ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]All right. I'll do my best
to persuade them to join us.[A]
[0AF0]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x13F][OpenMidLeft]Fluorspar[.][ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]His Majesty[.]
gave me this name.[A]
Therefore, I[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[0AF1]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x13F][OpenMidLeft]I am so[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]very tired[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
Now I, too[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]will[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[0AF2]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x114][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x126][OpenMidRight]Dame Selena[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A][Clear]
General Selena possessed
a curious stone.[A]
Myrrh, is this the
dragonstone you lost?[.][A][OpenMidRight]Yes, it is.[.][A]
But I'm saddened by its return.[.][A]
My dragonstone is here and yet[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
My heart is heavy with remorse[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]Myrrh[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]Ephraim, can you tell me
why this had to happen?[.][A]
Dame Selena was a good person.[A]
She was filled with joy when
she spoke of the emperor.[.][A]
Why did Dame Selena[.]
have to die?[A]
Why did we have to take[.]
up arms against her?[A][OpenMidLeft]I'm sorry[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
If I could have convinced her to
lay down her arms, I would have.[A]
It was simply not possible. I had[.]
no choice. She had to die.[A]
I know you don't approve, but you[.]
must know I have my reasons.[A][OpenMidRight]My apologies[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
Ephraim, I[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
I am not seeking to blame you.[A]
It's just that[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]I grieve for her.[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]I ventured out of the forest,[.]
chasing after that dark energy.[.][A]
I thought perhaps that I could
negate its evil force.[A]
Is your cause so different from[.]
Selena's?[.][A]
How many good people must die[.]
alongside the wicked?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Myrrh[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]What can we do to end this without
any more good people dying?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]I don't have any answer for you.[A]
But I will continue on toward the capital,
and perhaps I will find one there.[A]
I will learn the truth behind this madness.[.][A]
[0AF3]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x114][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x13F][OpenMidLeft]Are you Selena?[.][A][OpenMidRight]Indeed I am. And you
are Prince Ephraim.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]I know you've spoken with Myrrh.[A]
Withdraw your troops. You must
know the emperor is not rational![.][A][OpenMidRight]Yes, I know.[A][OpenMidLeft]Then why? Why do we still fight?[A][OpenMidRight]I am a general of the empire.[.]
His Majesty's word is law.[A][OpenMidLeft]That's ridiculous. You know the emperor is
deranged, and yet you follow his orders?![.][A]
Is that truly loyalty?![.][A][OpenMidRight]Prince Ephraim, you cannot understand.[A]
I know the path I'm given is foolish.[.]
Yet I am a knight, and I have no other.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Selena, please![.][A]
Surrender! I have no wish[.]
to see you die here![A][OpenMidRight]Me? Die?[A]
Prince Ephraim, you misunderstand me.[.]
I have no intention of dying.[.][A]
Madness though it may be, I will be[.]
the one doing the killing today.[A]
[0AF4]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x125][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x13F][OpenMidLeft]Well met, Selena.[.][A][OpenMidRight]General Duessel[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
I must offer you my apologies.[A]
I called you a traitor, but[.]
I was mistaken.[.][A]
Your loyalty never wavered,[.]
not for an instant.[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]And yet you must know that I have[.]
no intention of withdrawing.[A]
So let us not waste words. Let us[.]
settle this with steel, my friend.[A][OpenMidLeft]That's how it is to be, then? One[.]
of us dies by the other's hands?[A][OpenMidRight]Yes. It's the path
I've chosen.[A]
I have no regrets.[A][OpenMidLeft]I see[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
Well. I, too, must follow[.]
the path that I have chosen.[A][OpenMidRight]Very well.[A]
[0AF5]
[OpenLeft][LoadFace][0x114][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x11B][OpenMidRight]Are you Ephraim?[A][OpenLeft]Yes, I am, but[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]I'm Gerik, mercenary commander.[.][A][Clear]
Prince Innes bought our swords
and sent us here to join you.[.][A]
Any problem with that?[A][OpenLeft]Innes sent you?[.][A][OpenMidRight]Yeah, and the prince had a
message for you as well.[A]
He said, [OpenQuote]I've no need of assistance,[.]
Ephraim, but I'm sure you do.[CloseQuote][A]
That's all. I figured you would[.]
know what he was talking about.[.][A][OpenLeft]Well, that's definitely from Innes.[.][A]
Regardless, your aid is welcome.
Please join us in our fight.[A]
[0AF6]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x11B][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x11E][OpenMidLeft]Chief.[A][OpenMidRight]Oh, Marisa![.]
So Ewan found you after all, eh?[A]
Sorry for the trouble. Appears
the guild made an error.[A]
Blast it all. I should have 
double-checked everything myself.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]No worries.[.][A]
I'm with you now.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Have you taken any wounds?[A]
They sent you all the way to Taizel,
after all. What ill luck that was[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]I'm fine.[.][A]
I'll fight at your side.[A][OpenMidRight]Ah, that's comforting. We've been hired[.]
to guard a Prince Ephraim.[A]
Before we do, though, we'd better take
care of these enemy troops, huh?[A]
Let's move, Marisa.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Understood.[.][A]
[0AF7]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x11C][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x121][OpenMidLeft][MoveMidLeft][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Ah! Sister![.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]Ewan, you've completed the task[.]
you were given, haven't you?[A]
This is a dangerous place. Please,
go wait at the inn.[.][A]
I'll be there to collect you
as soon as I'm able.[A][OpenMidLeft]No way! I want to fight, too.[.][A]
I've become friends with
Prince Ephraim, you know?[.][A]
We're going to take out the[.]
big, bad evil empire.[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidRight]Wait just a minute, Ewan![.][A]
Ah! Ooh, that troublemaker.[.][A]
[0AF8]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x160][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0xFFFF][OpenMidLeft]You must have gone through
a lot to make it here.[A]
Did you come to warn us[.]
about the fighting going on?[A]
Thanks so much.[.][A]
Here, please take this staff.[.]
Oh, go on. Don't be shy.[A]
[0AF9]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x162][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0xFFFF][OpenMidLeft]Dame Selena often visits our
village when she's on patrol.[.][A]
She even came to our aid when[.]
we were attacked by bandits.[A]
[ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
Please, I beg of you. Don't[.]
hurt Dame Selena.[.][A]
[0AFA]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x114][OpenMidRight]The Grado capital[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][Clear]
It looks like it hasn't changed at
all since the last time I was here.[.][A]
Eirika and I came here once long
ago with our father.[A]
Duessel taught me the lance, and
I studied history with Lyon.[A][Clear]
I never imagined I'd come back
here armed for battle.[A]
[0AFB]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x12E][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x150][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]And so the hero Grado and his companions
used the five Sacred Stones to seal away[A]
the evil of the Demon King, and his wicked
soul was locked within the Stone of Grado.[A]
The Stone of Grado came to be known[.]
as the Fire Emblem.[.][A]
To this day, it's kept safe and honored[.]
as a national treasure of the empire.[.][A]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]I think that's about it.[A][Clear]
For more on Grado's life, read [OpenQuote]Founding
Emperor Grado.[CloseQuote] It's comprehensive.[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]It's so thick.[A]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]And the letters are so small.[.][A][OpenMidRight]But you have to read it. You don't want[.]
Father MacGregor to discipline you again.[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]I'm no good with books.[.][A]
The problem is they don't move.[.]
I get bored silly.[A]
I understand so much better when
you explain it to me, Lyon.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Yes, but[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]it's kind of weird to[.]
be helping you all the time.[A][Clear]
It's just that I admire you, Ephraim.[.][A]
I want to be strong, like you[.][ToggleMouthMove]--[ToggleMouthMove]brave[.]
and handsome[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][Clear]
I've got an idea. Why don't you teach[.]
me to wield a lance, Ephraim?[.][A]
I can't let my defeat to Eirika go
unchallenged. I look foolish.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]It's a deal.
We practice tomorrow, though.[.][A]
If you want to beat Eirika, you[.]
have to take this seriously.[A][OpenMidRight]Just go easy on me, all right?[A]
[0AFC]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x114][OpenFarLeft][LoadFace][0x126][OpenFarLeft]Ephraim[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
Aaaah![A][OpenFarLeft][MoveFarLeft][OpenMidRight][MoveMidRight][CloseSpeechSlow][LoadOverworldFaces][OpenMidRight]Another tremor[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
They happen a lot, don't they?[A][CloseSpeechSlow][OpenMidRight][MoveRight][OpenRight]Are you all right, Myrrh?[.][A][OpenFarLeft]Yes, I was startled.[A]
Ephraim, this place[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
Did it always shake like this?[A][OpenRight]Yeah, Grado's been prone to[.]
earthquakes for a long time.[A]
Tiny tremors like that happen[.]
all the time. Don't worry.[A][OpenFarLeft]Really?[.][A]
Um, Ephraim?[A][OpenFarLeft][MoveMidLeft][OpenRight]What is it?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]I can feel it[.][ToggleMouthMove]--[ToggleMouthMove]from inside the[.]
castle, I can feel the darkness.[A]
I feel a broad pool of darkness[.]
deep within its walls.[A][OpenRight]Perhaps it's coming from the
throne room.[A]
That's where Emperor Vigarde,[.]
the man who started this, is.[.][A]
Let's go.[.][A]

When you died, I couldn't[.]
accept the loss[.][ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]I[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
If only I'd been stronger[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]

[ToggleSmile][LoadOverworldFaces]Let me tell you something, Ephraim.[.][A]

No, MY plaything.[.][A]
I've been planning this my whole life.
Why else would I befriend you and Eirika?[.][A][Clear]
I needed to learn where and how to
attack and destroy Renais[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[ToggleSmile]Thanks to the two of you, I learned[.]
all I needed to know.[.][A]
While you feigned compassion for my[.]

Lyon[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
You're wrong. We never[ToggleMouthMove]--[ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]And then my chance arrived.[.][A]
I replaced my useless father, readied[.]
my tools, and set my plan in motion.[A]
I began by destroying Renais[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
And then I murdered your father.[A][OpenMidRight]You[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
You lie, Lyon!
You could never[.][ToggleMouthMove]--[ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Shall I tell you a story? Would you like

No more insults to my father,[.]

But, not even you can stop me now.[A][Clear]
The Stones of Frelia and Renais are dust,[.]

[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x114][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[0B08]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x16A][OpenMidRight]Reporting in, sir!
We've found a cell in the back.[.][A]
There were captives[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[0B09]
[OpenFarRight][LoadFace][0x104][OpenRight][LoadFace][0x114][OpenFarFarLeft][LoadFace][0x129][SendToBack][OpenFarFarLeft]Who is it?[A][OpenFarRight]Ah![.][A][OpenFarFarLeft][MoveFarLeft][OpenFarLeft]Has my execution been[.]
moved up on the schedule?[.][A]
Wait. You're not a Grado
soldier. Who are you?[.][A][OpenRight]I am Ephraim of Renais.[.]
And who are you?[A][OpenFarLeft]That's an odd question for an[.]
executioner. My name is Knoll.[A]
Until recently, I was one of Grado's
top researchers in arcane matters.[A][OpenFarRight]So why is it you are locked up here?[A][OpenFarLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenRight]You need not answer if you do not wish to.
Tell me, what is Lyon attempting to do?[.][A]
I still have things I intend to ask him.[A][OpenFarLeft]You wish to speak to Prince Lyon?[.][A]
You really don't know anything,[.]
do you?[.][A][OpenRight]What do you mean?[.][A]
Is there something wrong with[.]
Lyon? What do you know?[.][A][OpenFarLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
I'll tell you all I know, if
you would like.[.][A]
However, I think you will not[.]
thank me once you hear it.[A][CloseSpeechSlow][OpenFarLeft]It all began one year ago[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
That was when the emperor died.[.][A]
The emperor's health worsened,
and then he[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenRight]Hold.[.]
What are you about?[.][A]
One year ago? That's before Grado's[.]
invasion of Renais began.[.][A]
And I just saw the emperor.[.]
I killed him with my own hands.[.][A][OpenFarLeft]Allow me to continue in the order[.]
in which everything occurred.[.][A]
One year ago, the emperor died of[.]
the illness that had plagued him.[.][A]
Prince Lyon was devastated. He
fell into an endless despair.[.][A]
He felt unworthy to take the throne,
unable to rule without his father.[A][OpenRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenFarLeft]He then began to look for a way to
overturn his father's demise.[.][A]
He wanted to resurrect him[ToggleMouthMove]--[ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenRight]Wait, resurrect him?[A][OpenFarLeft]Yes.[A]
As you know, the Stone of Grado is
possessed of[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]unique powers.[A]
It was once used to seal away the Demon[.]
King, and it alone held the dark one's soul.[A]
It burned within with the Demon King's
rage, and we called it the Fire Emblem.[.][A][Clear]
Prince Lyon and a team of mages skilled in
ancient lore hoped to harness its energies.[.][A]
I remember the joy in Prince Lyon's eyes
when he spoke of using it to save lives.[A][OpenRight]Lyon[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenFarLeft]Prince Lyon told us he intended to use
the Fire Emblem to restore the emperor.[.][A]
His death had been kept from the public,
but rumors were beginning to fly.[.][A]
We knew we had to hurry, before the people
learned the truth of the emperor's death.[.][A]
Prince Lyon dedicated himself to research,
skipping meals, foregoing sleep[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
And then[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenRight]What happened?[A][OpenFarLeft]I wasn't there, so I did not
witness it firsthand.[.][A]
By the time I arrived, the
deed had already been done.[.][A][Clear]
The Fire Emblem had been
shattered, split in two.[A]
One was a Sacred Stone,[.]
and the other[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[0B0A]
[OpenLeft][LoadFace][0x150][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x12F][OpenMidRight]Prince Lyon!
What's happened?[A]
Prince[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenLeft]Oh, hello, it's you[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
What was your name again?[.][A]
Ah, yes. Knoll. You're one
of my researchers.[A][Clear]
I've glad tidings for you.
My father is back.[A][OpenMidRight]The emperor?[A]
[0B0B]
[OpenLeft][LoadFace][0x14F][OpenFarLeft][LoadFace][0x150][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x12F][SendToBack][OpenLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenFarLeft]Come, Father[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
Open your eyes.[.][A][OpenLeft][HalfCloseEyes][OpenLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]Your[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]Your Majesty![.]
This is incredible![.][A]
Prince Lyon, what miracle[.]
is this? It cannot be![A]
What[ToggleMouthMove]--? [ToggleMouthMove]What is that stone?[.][A][OpenFarLeft]This? This is the Dark Stone. It bears
even more power than any Sacred Stone.[A]
I extracted and condensed all of the
magic bound within the Fire Emblem.[.][A]
The Dark Stone's power is what gave[.]
my father back the spark of life.[.][A][OpenMidRight]The Dark Stone[ToggleMouthMove]...?[ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenFarLeft]Now that the Dark Stone is mine, I
have no need for this empty husk.[.][A]
[0B0C]
[OpenLeft][LoadFace][0x14F][OpenLeft][HalfCloseEyes][OpenFarLeft][LoadFace][0x150][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x12F][SendToBack][OpenMidRight]P-Prince Lyon! The Sacred Stone[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
What have you done?[.][A][OpenFarLeft]They are all in the way.
The Sacred Stones, I mean.[A]
Four more remain, and they
must all be destroyed.[A][CloseSpeechSlow][OpenFarLeft]The only stone we need now
is this Dark Stone of mine.[.][A]
[0B0D]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x129][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x114][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]After that[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
His Majesty ordered the invasion of[.]
Renais, as Prince Lyon asked him to.[A][Clear]
Father MacGregor grew concerned with
Prince Lyon's health.[.][A]
He tried several times to dissuade him
from his path.[A]
Prince Lyon executed him personally.[A][Clear]
I, too, was branded a traitor and arrested.[.]
My execution was scheduled for tomorrow.[A][OpenMidRight]Lyon[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
Where is he now?[A][OpenMidLeft]Would that I knew.[A]
Prince Lyon frightens me now.[.][A]
He is[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]transformed[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]He's[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][Clear]
Lyon is my friend.[A]
[0B0E]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x129][OpenMidLeft]This way, Prince Ephraim.[.][A]
I believe it's here[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x114][OpenMidRight]What is it?[.]
What is this place?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]This is the former resting place of[.]
the Stone of Grado, the Fire Emblem.[A]
We've kept the Sacred Twins of Grado
here as well.[.][A]
If we're still lucky, they may still
be here.[A][OpenMidRight]The Sacred Twins[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
Those are the ancient weapons once
wielded by the founders of our nations.[.][A]
Let's see if I remember my studies[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
Emperor Grado's were the magic tome[.]
Gleipnir and Garm, the black axe.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]That is correct.
You know your history well.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Yeah, it's something I learned
long ago from Lyon.[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]Well, let's see if they're
still here, shall we?[.][A]
[0B0F]
[OpenLeft][LoadFace][0x104][OpenLeft]Prince Ephraim.[.][A]
Here[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]I've found the
Sacred Twin relics.[.][A][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x114][OpenMidRight]And here they are[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
Yet I don't understand.[.][A]
The Sacred Stone was destroyed,[.]
but these were left untouched?[A]
Why?[A][OpenFarLeft][LoadFace][0x129][OpenFarLeft]I know not[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
Perhaps[.][ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]No, never mind.[.]
It's an idle thought.[.][A][Clear]
Prince Ephraim, please take[.]
these relics with you.[A][OpenMidRight]Is that all right?[A][OpenFarLeft]Yes. I want you to have them. And maybe[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
Maybe someone else wanted you to have[.]
them as well.[.][A]
[0B10]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x114][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x169][OpenMidLeft]Prince Ephraim![.][A][OpenMidRight]You've come at a good time, soldier.
I want you to take a message to Frelia.[.][A]
Actually[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft][MoveMidLeft][OpenMidLeft]We've received dire news from Jehanna![A]
It's about Princess Eirika and
Prince Innes[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
They're under attack by Grado forces
led by Tiger Eye and Moonstone.[.][A][OpenMidRight][MoveRight][OpenRight]Eirika[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenFarRight][LoadFace][0x104][SendToBack][OpenFarRight]Caellach Tiger Eye and
Valter Moonstone[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
They're supposed to be the most[.]
powerful of Grado's imperial generals.[A]
For them to have abandoned the capital
and lead the battle into Jehanna[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]The Knights of Rausten have ridden to[.]
the eastern front to aid Frelia, but[A]
the enemy attacks have been brutal.[.]
I fear for their survival.[A][OpenRight]We march for Jehanna immediately![.]
We will rescue Eirika.[A][OpenMidLeft]B-but even if we leave now, we
will not make it in time[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenRight]We'll make it. Rest easy on that.[.][A][Clear]
Eirika is my sister. That one will
never lay down her blade.[.][A]
And I am Eirika's brother. There is[.]
no way I'll let my sister die![A]
[0B11]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x124][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x114][OpenMidRight]You there, hold.[A][OpenMidLeft]Huh?[.....] [.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]You're a man. Sorry,
pal, but I'm not interested in men.[.][A][OpenMidRight]What are you doing here in the castle?[A]
You seem to be weighed down a bit.
Helping yourself to the treasure?[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Ha! I've no idea what you're
talking about.[A][Clear]
Now, wait a minute[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
You couldn't be[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
Aren't you Prince Ephraim?!?[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]Hm? I'm Ephraim, but[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]I-I thought so. You're the one
they call the Beast of Renais[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
I've heard tales of how you've looted[.]
and pillaged your way across the land[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]What?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]H-hold on! Calm down! You won't[.]
get any treasure by killing me.[.][A]
If you want these goods, it'll
cost you. 10,000 gold.[A][OpenMidRight]10,000 gold?[A][OpenMidLeft]Yeah[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
Is that too high?[.][A]
Fine, then you get my sword[.]
as well. I'll join your army.[.][A]
So that's me and the treasure for[.]
only 9,980 gold! What do you say?[.][A][OpenMidRight]You know, I have no idea how I
got pulled into this conversation.[A]
9,980 gold, eh?[.][A]
[0B12]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x124][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x114][OpenMidLeft]What? You again?[A]
How about it? Gathered
up 9,980 gold yet?[A]
[0B13]
[OpenMidRight]I don't have that kind of money.[A][OpenMidLeft]What? You're lying now, aren't you?[.][A]
Rumor has it you've stored away so
much gold, you groan from its weight[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight][ClearFace][CloseSpeechSlow][OpenMidLeft]Whoa! H-hold on a moment![.][A]
You're not going to kill me just because
you can't afford my price, are you?[.][A]
[0B14]
[OpenMidRight]I haven't decided yet[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
[Yes]
[0B15]
[OpenMidRight]Here's 9,980 gold.
Is this sufficient?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Huh?[A]
M-may I really take it?[.][A][OpenMidRight]Sorry?[.....]
You set the price yourself, didn't you?[.][A]
Now that I've hired you, I intend to
get my money's worth.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]You[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]aren't going to stab me once
I've taken your money, are you?[.][A]
Once the fighting's all done, you won't[.]
burn me at the stake or anything?[.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]What rumors are these people
spreading about me?[.][A]
[0B16]
[OpenMidRight]Sorry, but I don't actually[.]
have the gold to hire you.[A][OpenMidLeft]What? You're lying now, aren't you?[.][A]
Rumor has it you've stored away so
much gold, you groan from its weight[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight][ClearFace][CloseSpeechSlow][OpenMidLeft]Whoa! H-hold on a moment![.][A]
You're not going to kill me just because
you can't afford my price, are you?[.][A]
[0B17]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x102][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x104][OpenMidRight]Princess Eirika,
are you well?[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]Princess Eirika![A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]Oh[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]Seth?[.][A][OpenMidRight]Yes, it's me.[.][A]
Please, you must rest. If we
continue like this, you'll[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]No[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]it's all right.[.]
We're all suffering[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
We're still completely surrounded[.]
by Grado's armies[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
We may all die at any moment[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
I can't lose focus now.[.][A]
Has anything changed?[.][A][OpenMidRight]Unfortunately, no. On every front, our
forces meet with defeat upon defeat.[A]
Rausten's knights are scattered and worn,[.]
and the enemy is closing in around them.[A]
And this accursed sand[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
Most of the units can't get proper
footing and are being slowed down.[A]
Mounted units are having the worst time,
as their movement is severely limited.[A]
Princess Eirika[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][......]
I ask that you leave for safety.[A]
We'll use flying units and magic users
to hold the foe here.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]No. I will not retreat.[.][A]
If I give up now[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
My brother would not forgive me.[A]
I'm the princess of Renais. I will
fight, either to victory or to death.[.][A][CloseSpeechSlow][OpenMidLeft]Brother, I[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[0B18]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x148][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x142][OpenMidLeft]Valter[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
You should stop playing around.[.][A]
If you don't finish off Eirika's
forces swiftly[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
Her brother's left the capital. He
should be arriving here shortly.[A]
You don't want to be fighting her[.]
still when he arrives. Trust me.[A]
We are equals here in Grado's army.[.]
Would you like me to assist?[A][OpenMidRight]All you need to do is vanish,[.]
you disgusting old man.[.][A]
Eirika is mine.[.]
I won't let you have her.[.][A]
She is so strong, so beautiful[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
She's the prey I've dreamed of.[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Heh heh heh[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[ToggleSmile]Your fangs are still sharp, eh?[.]
Good. Very good.[A][Clear]
Ah, Valter[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]You're a beast.[.][A]
You're bound to no country. You[.]
care nothing for friend or foe.[.][A]
Kill a man, claim a woman[.][ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]You live
for nothing more, you wretched beast.[.][A]
That's your strength. That's what makes[.]
you stronger than any man alive.[A]
A beast acts without remorse. Man's[.]
morality cannot win. It's nature's way[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
The stage is all yours, Valter. Do
not fail to get the girl's bracelet.[A]
Our master demands it[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidRight]The time is nigh, Eirika[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][Clear]
Come to me![.][A]
[0B19]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x114][OpenMidLeft]There's Jehanna Hall[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
It's nothing but a ruin now.[A]
Blast! I don't know what's
happened, but[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
I'd better get to Eirika and the
others as soon as possible.[.][A][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x104][OpenMidRight]I've discovered which of Grado's generals[.]
lead the forces surrounding the hall.[.][A]
Valter the Moonstone and
Caellach the Tiger Eye.[.][A]
Two of the strongest of the empire's
generals, with near-peerless forces.[A]
Above all else, we must rescue Princess[.]
Eirika, and yet[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
If you fall, Prince Ephraim, we're all
finished. And this accursed sand[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
Most of the units can't get proper
footing and are being slowed down.[A]
Mounted units are having the worst time,
as their movement is severely limited.[A]
Some of us can move better than[.]
others, though[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
A combination of magic wielders and sky[.]
riders should give us some advantage.[.][A]
Whatever we do, we must move cautiously.[A][OpenMidLeft]I understand. This is just
like the battle for Renvall.[A]
We either rescue Eirika or
defeat all the enemy troops.[A]
If we accomplish either goal,[.]
victory is ours.[A][Clear]
Let's move![.][A]
[0B1A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x146][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x143][OpenMidLeft]How goes it, Caellach?[A][OpenMidRight]Ah, Prince Lyon.[A]
Thank you, Your Highness, for gracing[.]
me with[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]your royal[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]er[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]You can stop. There's no need for you to
put on airs.[A]
You were made general for your military[.]
prowess, not your flowery speech.[.][A][OpenMidRight]And an honor it is.[.][A]
You know, Prince Lyon, you've got a lot of
nerve.[A]
You've really worked over your dear friend
the princess of Renais. Are you satisfied?[A][OpenMidLeft]Is there some reason you ask?[.][A][OpenMidRight]No, not really.[.][A]
I just wanted to see how
you'd react. That's all.[A][OpenMidLeft]She[.][ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]Eirika has always been
a very important person in my life.[.][A]
Both she and her brother have been
friends of mine for a long time.[A]
Tell me, Caellach, do you have any
friends to speak of?[A][OpenMidRight]Huh?
Yeah, I got one.[A]
An old mercenary I fought with, went
by the name of Joshua.[A]
He was a fool and a scoundrel, but
now that he's gone, I miss the lad.[.][A]
I don't know where he's at or what
he's doing, but[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]Do you miss that life? Do you ever want[.]
to be a mercenary again, to see him?[A][OpenMidRight]Nope. The time we worked together was[.]
fun and all, but[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]No.[.][A]
I don't want to end up another no-name
mercenary lying dead in a ditch.[A]
I'd rather serve the Grado Empire[.]
and make a name for myself.[.][A]
I'm going to see how far my axe will
take me. And then, one day[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]One day, you'll kill me and be
emperor in my stead. Is that it?[A][OpenMidRight]Uh[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]That's[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]It's all right. Think whatever you
like if it helps you do your duty.[A]
As long as you do what I assign you[.]
to do, I'm happy.[.][A]
But for now, I'm going. You know
what you need to do.[A][OpenMidRight]Yep, leave it to me.[A]
I am General Caellach, the Tiger Eye
of the Grado Imperial Army, after all![A]
Once my prey is within my reach,
I never let it escape.[A]
Too bad for the princess, but they've[.]
no chance at winning. None at all.[A]
[0B1B]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x114][OpenMidLeft]That building beyond the dunes
is Jehanna Hall.[A]
I expect that's where we'll find
Eirika and her companions.[A]
Duessel, Knoll.[.][A]
It's time we rescued Eirika.
I'll need all your strength.[A][OpenRight][LoadFace][0x125][OpenRight]Of course, Your Highness.[.][A]
I've pledged my service and[.]
my axe. You shall have both.[A][OpenFarRight][LoadFace][0x129][OpenFarRight]Princess Eirika[.][ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]She's a[.]
friend of Prince Lyon's, isn't she?[.][A]
I'll do what I can to help you.[.][A]
I feel like that is what Prince[.]
Lyon would want.[A][OpenMidLeft]The enemy's numbers are great, but
we do not need to face them alone.[A]
We must move quickly to join forces[.]
with Eirika and her company.[A]
I'm sure Seth and Innes will be[.]
there waiting for us.[.][A]
Let's move![.][A]
[0B1C]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x102][OpenMidLeft]Prince Innes[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
And Saleh.[A]
I'm sorry. I'm absolutely[.]
powerless here[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenRight][LoadFace][0x10F][OpenRight]Eirika, you have nothing to apologize for.
We're not defeated yet.[.][A]
Jehanna Hall has fallen, that much is true.[.][A]
But if we can hold out until Ephraim arrives,[.]
we still have a chance of victory.[A][OpenFarRight][LoadFace][0x120][OpenFarRight]And reports place Lady Myrrh at[.]
Prince Ephraim's side.[A]
It is my duty to protect her.[.][A]
I will not die without having[.]
fulfilled my obligation to her.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]You're right[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
I made a promise, too.[A]
I told Ephraim I would live to see
him again.[A]
We have to pull together. All of us. We[.]
just have to hold out a little longer.[A]
If we pool our strength now, I vow that we
will all live to see our friends again.[.][A]
[0B1D]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x142][OpenMidLeft]Mmm[.][ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]I've been waiting[.]
for you, Eirika![A][OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102][OpenMidRight]Who are you?[A][OpenMidRight][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x142][OpenMidLeft]Have you forgotten? We met
once at Castle Renais.[A]
No? Look closely, Eirika.[.][A]
Do you not remember the face
of he who will master you?[A][OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102][OpenMidRight]Wha[.][ToggleMouthMove]--!?[ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x142][OpenMidLeft]Yes, resist.[A]
It's much more fun
for me that way.[A]
Come, Eirika. I should
like to tame you.[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102][OpenMidRight]I am here on a mission.[.][A]
One that I swore to my
brother I would fulfill.[A]
I will not be stopped by
the likes of you![.][A][OpenMidRight][ClearFace]
[0B1E]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x142][OpenMidLeft]Hello again, Ephraim.[.][A]
I let you flee once, but this[.]
time, there's no escape.[A][OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x114][OpenMidRight]Escape?[.]
I'm not going anywhere.[.][A]
I came here for you.
I came to defeat you.[.][A][OpenMidRight][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x142][OpenMidLeft]What's this?[A]
A scurrying little mouse
that roars like a lion?[.][A]
Are you saying this time
will be different than last?[A]
Will you finally provide me[.]
with some amusement?[A][OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x114][OpenMidRight]I'll do far more than that.[.][A]
I'll provide you with a messy[.]
end to your sorry life.[.][A][OpenMidRight][ClearFace]
[0B1F]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x142][OpenMidLeft]What now, Cormag?[.][A]
Have you betrayed your
oaths and your emperor?[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x113][OpenMidRight]I have.[.][A]
I can no longer serve Grado.[A]
But I must know the truth,
Valter, and you will tell me.[.][A]
You're the one who murdered[.]
my brother, aren't you?[.][A][OpenMidRight][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x142][OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]Hmph.[.][A]
No reason for lies, seeing as[.]
you're nothing but a traitor.[.][A]
You're right, Cormag![.][A]
I was the one who cut your
brother down.[.][A]
He was just like you, a[.]
weak, pitiful fool.[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x113][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A][Clear]
Ha[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]ha ha ha[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x142][OpenMidLeft]Why do you laugh, dolt?[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x113][OpenMidRight]How can I not?[A]
I've dreamt of revenge,[.]
chased it for days[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
And now, it's here before me![.][A]
Oh, Valter[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]Your death
will be slow and agonizing.[.][A][OpenMidRight][ClearFace]
[0B20]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x142][OpenMidLeft]Is that you, Cormag?[A]
Even you have turned your[.]
back on your emperor?[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x113][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x142][OpenMidLeft]Don't tell me you stand there[.]
thinking you can beat me.[.][A]
You're not strong enough.[.]
You know this to be true.[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x113][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x142][OpenMidLeft]If you swear fealty to Grado
again, I may let you live.[A]
You don't want to die an
oath breaker, do you?[.][A]
Well? Will you crawl before me
and beg for forgiveness?[A][OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x113][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]Yes, I have broken my[.]
vows, Valter.[.][A]
And yes, it may be I who falls
when we tilt lances[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
But a dog like you will never[.]
see me crawl.[.][A][OpenMidRight][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x142][OpenMidLeft]Brave words from a traitor.[.][A]
Let's see if your lance is
as sharp as your tongue.[A][OpenMidLeft][ClearFace]
[0B21]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x12A][OpenMidRight]Caellach.[.][A][OpenMidRight][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x143][OpenMidLeft]Hey!
If it isn't Joshua.[.][A]
It's been a long time.
Have you been well?[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x12A][OpenMidRight]I've been all right. Still
working as a mercenary.[.][A]
When did you get all proper[.]
and join the Grado army?[A][OpenMidRight][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x143][OpenMidLeft]Didn't I tell you?[A]
I wasn't about to waste my
life as a nameless soldier.[.][A]
Still, I think back on those
days a lot lately[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
My axe and your sword[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
The two of us were a deadly[.]
pair, eh?[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x12A][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x143][OpenMidLeft]By the way[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
I know all about you, Joshua.[.][A]
Who you really are I mean.
The prince of Jehanna, huh?[.][A]
When did you plan on sharing
the wealth, you sneaky dog?[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x12A][OpenMidRight]Listen[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
You can't reduce a nation to
loot waiting to be divided.[.][A]
And more importantly, I made
a vow to my mother.[.][A]
I'm going to succeed her as[.]
ruler of my homeland.[.][A][Clear]
Hey, Caellach[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
You're the one who killed[.]
my mother, aren't you?[A][OpenMidRight][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x143][OpenMidLeft]Yeah[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]Sorry 'bout that.[.]
Things happen, you know?[A]
C'mon, Joshua,
don't hate me.[A]
This is war. There's nothing
you can do about it.[A]
Besides, grudges get in the[.]
way of work, right?[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x12A][OpenMidRight]That's true.
It's as you say.[A]
Listen, Caellach[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
I've got to kill you now.[.][A]
Don't hold it against me.[.][A][OpenMidRight][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x143][OpenMidLeft]You arrogant[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
You haven't changed a bit![A]
I've always wanted to show
you who's better, Joshua.[.][A]
And I'm even stronger than
I used to be.[.][A]
I'm gonna wipe that smug look[.]
off your face for good![.][A][OpenMidLeft][ClearFace]
[0B22]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x12A][OpenMidRight]It's been a long
time, Caellach.[.][A][OpenMidRight][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x143][OpenMidLeft]Is that really you, Joshua?[.]
How long's it been?[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x12A][OpenMidRight]About two years[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
What've you been doing?[.][A]
You know, that innkeeper's
still mad you stiffed him.[A][OpenMidRight][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x143][OpenMidLeft]Oh, please[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
You telling me that old[.]
dog's still alive?[A]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]How's the rest of the[.]
troop doing?[A][OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x12A][OpenMidRight]They're getting by.[.][A]
Some of them ended up[.]
feeding the crows, though[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x143][OpenMidLeft]Is that so?[.][A]
Those were good times,
weren't they, Joshua?[.][A]
We were terrors on the
battlefield and worse off it.[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x12A][OpenMidRight]Yeah, we were.[A]
You'd get carried away and
pick fights with me[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
You always said the same
thing: [OpenQuote]I will be king![CloseQuote][A][OpenMidRight][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x143][OpenMidLeft]Yeah. That's my dream.[A]
And I'll do anything to[.]
make it come true.[A]
What do you say, Joshua?
Let's team up again?[A]
Leave those losers you're[.]
with and work for me.[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x12A][OpenMidRight]Sorry, can't do it.[.][A]
I'm not going to let
you use me for anything.[A][OpenMidRight][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x143][OpenMidLeft]Bah[.][ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]You're a cold[.]
fish, aren't you.[.][A]
That's one thing that hasn't
changed about you.[A][OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x12A][OpenMidRight]You haven't changed[.]
much either.[A]
You're still as[.]
shameless as ever.[A][OpenMidRight][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x143][OpenMidLeft]Ha ha!
That's the truth.[.][A][Clear]
Well[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
You want to get started?[A][OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x12A][OpenMidRight]Mm[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]Sure.[.][A][OpenMidRight][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x143][OpenMidLeft]I'm stronger than I used
to be.[A]
No offense, but you're not
in my league anymore.[.][A]
Don't hate me, Joshua.[A][OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x12A][OpenMidRight]Same to you.[A][OpenMidRight][ClearFace]
[0B23]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x142][OpenMidLeft]I've no use for these[.]
bloodless minnows[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
Give me prey that will
sate my bloodlust[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][Clear]
I hunger![.][A]
[0B24]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x142][OpenMidLeft]Urggh[.][ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]Gaaaah![.][A]
[0B25]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x143][OpenMidLeft]You're a stepping-stone[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
And I'm moving up.[A]
Don't take it personally.[.][A]
[0B26]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x143][OpenMidLeft]Bla[.][ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]Blast[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
A bit more, and[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]a crown[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
would have been[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]mine[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[0B27]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x114][OpenMidRight][MoveRight][OpenRight]Brother![A][OpenMidLeft]Eirika![.][A][OpenRight]Oh, Ephraim[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
I've missed you so.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]And I've missed you.[A]
I can't tell you how happy
I am to see you safe.[.][A][CloseSpeechSlow][OpenMidLeft]Oh, I almost forgot. I have[.]
something to give you.[A][OpenRight]What are these?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]These are called Sacred Twins. We[.]
took these relics from Grado.[.][A]
The dark tome Gleipnir and
the black axe Garm[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][Clear]
I doubt either of us can use them, but[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
Why not see if one of your companions can[.]
use them. They might have better luck.[A][OpenRight]They're from Grado?[.][A]
Does this mean Grado Keep[.]
has fallen?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Yes. I conquered the capital and
defeated Emperor Vigarde.[.][A]
But still[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenFarRight][LoadFace][0x122][OpenFarRight]Eirika, may I make
a suggestion?[.][A]
We've been able to
join forces here so[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
How about if we all get together
and trade information.[A]
There are people on both
sides waiting after all.[A]
[0B28]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x114][OpenMidLeft][MoveLeft][OpenLeft]Eirika![.][A][OpenMidRight]Brother![A][OpenLeft]You've done well, Eirika.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Thanks to you, Ephraim.[.][A]
Ah[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]Wait a moment.
I've something to give you.[.][A][OpenLeft]These are[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]These are the Sacred Twin[.]
relics of Jehanna.[A]
The ice sword Audhulma and
the wind blade Excalibur.[.][A][OpenLeft]Jehanna's Sacred Twins?[.][A]
But it seems like we were[.]
too late[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
Jehanna Hall has fallen.[A][OpenMidRight]Yes, and Queen Ismaire died[.]
resisting Grado.[A][OpenFarLeft][LoadFace][0x122][OpenFarLeft]Now that we have, at last, been[.]
reunited once again,[A]
perhaps this would be a good
time to share information.[A]
I'm sure we all are most anxious
to learn of what has happened.[A]
[0B29]
[OpenFarLeft][LoadFace][0x102][OpenLeft][LoadFace][0x114][OpenRight][LoadFace][0x10F][OpenFarRight][LoadFace][0x122][OpenLeft]I see unfamiliar faces among you here,
so allow me to introduce myself.[A]
I am Ephraim, Eirika's brother and
crown prince of Renais.[.][A][OpenFarRight]I'm Princess L'Arachel of Rausten.
The pleasure is mine, of course.[A][OpenLeft]I'll begin by telling you of
how we've fared in our mission.[.][A]
We seized the Grado capital and[.]
defeated her emperor, Vigarde.[A]
Grado's capital guard have, to a man,[.]
surrendered and laid down their arms.[.][A]
Pockets of resistance remain, but the[.]
war itself is over.[.][A][OpenRight]Is that so?[.][A][OpenLeft]However, something remains that[.]
still bothers me.[.][A]
A Grado man named Knoll told me about[.]
something called a [OpenQuote]Dark Stone.[CloseQuote][A][CloseSpeechSlow][OpenLeft]Their mages had uncovered lore that led[.]
them to craft a powerful magic stone.[.][A]
This Dark Stone may have been the[.]
catalyst of Grado's transformation.[.][A]
It seems to be the source of that black[.]
wave of energy Myrrh described.[.][A][CloseSpeechSlow][OpenLeft]Vigarde died some time ago, but the power[.]
of the stone played him like a puppet.[A]
The war and everything that passed since
was planned by the Dark Stone's master.[.][A][OpenRight]Well? Who is it?[A][LoadOverworldFaces][OpenLeft][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]I still can't believe it,[.]
but I'll tell you nonetheless.[A]
According to Knoll, the man behind
this is Lyon, the imperial prince.[A]
He said Lyon's got the Dark Stone.[A][OpenRight]Figures it's Prince Lyon[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenFarLeft]No, that doesn't make any sense.[A]
Ephraim and I know Lyon better than[.]
that. We've been friends for years.[.][A]
Lyon's not the sort of person who[.]
could start a war like this.[A][OpenRight]But, Eirika[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenFarLeft]I saw Lyon recently.[A]
Ephraim, you might know this, but after[.]
I abandoned the sea route to Rausten,[.][A]
I traveled overland with Prince[.]
Innes to Jehanna.[.][A]
We ran into trouble with Grado's
forces, and I chanced upon Lyon.[A]
He didn't share the details of his
situation, but he intimated that[A]
he was on our side. Despite all[.]
appearances, he was on our side.[A]
So Lyon[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenLeft]Eirika,[.]
I also met Lyon.[A][OpenFarLeft]Did you really?[.][A][OpenLeft]Yes. But, he was like a[.]
completely different person.[A]
To be honest, he didn't seem
to be completely[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]human.[A][OpenFarLeft]Ephraim[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
What are you saying?[A][OpenLeft]I'll tell you what I saw.[.][A]
I found Lyon inside Grado Keep.[.][A]
This is what he told me:
He said he was behind this war.[.][A]
He said he'd befriended us solely so that,
one day, he could invade Renais[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
He told me he killed our father.[A][OpenFarLeft]That[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]That can't[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenLeft]I know. I can't believe it either.
I refuse to believe it.[.][A]
How could he have planned all[.]
this since he was a child[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
I simply can't fathom it.[.][A][CloseSpeechSlow]
[0B2A]
[OpenLeft]I've heard Lyon changed when he acquired
the Dark Stone.[.][A]
I've no interest in magic, but[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
There was something uncanny about him.[A]
It seemed almost as though he were being
controlled by something himself.[A][OpenFarLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenRight]The two of you might find this hard[.]
to accept, but[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
The state of Prince Lyon's heart matters
little. He has the Dark Stone.[A]
That rock is the cause of all that's
happened. The prince must be stopped.[.][A][LoadOverworldFaces][OpenFarRight]Not yet. There is something[.]
that needs doing first.[.][A][OpenFarLeft]L'Arachel?[A][OpenFarRight]Prince Ephraim, I do believe you
felt it as well.[A]
The Dark Stone held by Prince Lyon[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
It exudes a malefic miasma[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
We might be able to handle Prince Lyon
alone, but that stone is beyond our ken.[A][OpenFarLeft]Then what do you suggest?[.][A][OpenFarRight]The Sacred Stones.[A][OpenFarLeft]The Sacred Stones?[A][OpenFarRight]We've all heard the legend of the[.]
five Sacred Stones.[.][A]
They alone possessed the power to[.]
seal the Demon King away forever.[.][A]
So, of course, to dispel demonic
magic, we must use the Sacred Stones![.][A][OpenRight]You expect us to pin the outcome
of this war on some fool legend?[A][OpenLeft][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]Not just the legend.
We also have hope.[A][CloseSpeechSlow][OpenLeft]According to Lyon,[A]
he has already seen to the destruction of[.]
Grado's, Frelia's, and Jehanna's stones.[A][OpenFarLeft]Hm. That explains something[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
Grado forces attacked me, intent on[.]
destroying the Stone of Renais.[.][A]
If that could be the reason they
chose to invade Renais[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
The power of the Sacred Stones may
be greater than we'd ever known.[A][OpenFarRight]Yes, exactly![.][A]
If we acquire a Sacred Stone, we'll be
able to oppose the Dark Stone's might![A][OpenRight]But three of the stones have been[.]
shattered, and our options are few.[.][A]
Do you suppose that, during the[.]
invasion of Renais[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenLeft]No, I don't think so.[.][A]
The Stone of Renais is hidden by the
power of Eirika's and my bracelets.[.][A][OpenFarLeft]Grado has made many attempts
to take our bracelets.[A]
Every one has failed, and so
the stone may still be safe.[A][OpenLeft]We have to confirm that, of course.[.][A]
We've defeated Grado, and we must[.]
turn our eyes to our homeland.[A]
It's time to return to Renais.[A]
[0B2B]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x126][OpenFarRight][LoadFace][0x120][OpenFarRight][MoveMidRight][OpenMidRight]Lady Myrrh.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Saleh[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]I'm grateful to see you well.[.][A]
The people of Caer Pelyn will[.]
be overjoyed that you're safe.[A][OpenMidLeft]I must apologize to you, Saleh.[.][A]
You were there to protect me from[.]
the very start of my journey.[.][A]
When we were attacked, I was
separated from you, and[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
I'm so sorry to have worried you.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Lady Myrrh.[.][A]
As long as you are safe, we have
nothing to be worried about.[A]
It will be my honor to serve you
until your mission is complete.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Thank you, Saleh.[.][A]
[0B2C]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x114][OpenMidLeft]Eirika![.][A][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102][OpenMidRight]Brother?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Is that really you? You're
not some phantom, are you?[A][OpenMidLeft]No, it's really me.[.][A]
Hold.[.]
Enemies approach.[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]Ephraim.[A]
Even when we were children, you[.]
were always there to protect me.[A]
[0B2D]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x114][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x104][OpenMidRight]Prince Ephraim.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]It's good to see you, Seth.[.]
You've served Eirika well.[A]
I knew my sister would be safe
as long as you were with her.[.][A][OpenMidRight]No, she's safe only because you[.]
came to our aid today.[A]
Our situation still is not one
to promote optimism, but[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]Yes, this is the crux of the war.[.][A]
The majority of Grado's strength
is arrayed before us[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
We're going to win, Seth.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Yes, sir.[.][A]
[0B2E]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x114][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x116][OpenMidLeft]Forde![A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Ah, greetings, Prince Ephraim. Your[.]
timing is flawless, as ever.[A]
Riding in at the nick of time with your[.]
armor shining and your lance ready[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
It must be nice to be the dashing hero.[.]
I'd like to try it someday.[.][A][ToggleSmile][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]That's just like you, Forde.[A]
You make even a crisis such as this[.]
seem like a stroll in the garden.[.][A][OpenMidRight]They say that's one of my best traits.[A]
You know, Prince Ephraim, you've changed
since the last time I saw you.[A]
You're more[.][ToggleMouthMove]--[ToggleMouthMove]how should I put it?[ToggleMouthMove]--[ToggleMouthMove]kingly?[.]
Is that even a word?[A][OpenMidLeft]You've changed a bit, too. It looks[.]
like the journey has made you strong.[.][A]
What say we show the Grado stragglers[.]
how tough we've become? Let's go![.][A][OpenMidRight]Music to my ears, milord.[.][A]
[0B2F]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x114][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x118][OpenMidLeft]Kyle![.][A][OpenMidRight]Prince Ephraim![.][A][OpenMidLeft]You've done a great service in
protecting Eirika all this time.[A]
Assigning you the task was the
right thing to do.[A][OpenMidRight]It was no task[ToggleMouthMove]--[ToggleMouthMove]it was an honor. I shall
continue to protect her as best I can.[A]
Until your orders for me change, my[.]
prince, I'll guard her well.[A][OpenMidLeft]We'll do so together, Kyle, because[.]
this is where we join our forces.[.][A]
Let's you and I finish off these
last remnants of Grado's army.[A][OpenMidRight]Yes, sir![.][A][OpenMidLeft]It looks like you've had plenty of
chances to improve your swordsmanship.[A]
I expect you to surprise me out there.[A][OpenMidRight]You've grown yourself, milord.[A]
You've the dignity of a king now.[.]
Like your father before you.[A][OpenMidLeft]D-do you mean that?[.]
You must be mistaken.[.][A][OpenMidRight]I am not! It is precisely why I am,[.]
now and forever, your loyal servant![A]
[0B30]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x114][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x10F][OpenMidRight]It's been a long time, Ephraim.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Innes, is that you?[.][A][OpenMidRight]You arrived sooner
than I'd expected.[A]
Eirika is safe. You've
no need to worry.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]I've heard that you've been[.]
watching over Eirika.[.][A]
I should like to offer you
my gratitude.[.][A][OpenMidRight]It's not necessary. Besides,
there's still a war to be won.[A]
We can't rest easy till every last
Grado soldier's been defeated.[A][OpenMidLeft]You're right. Let's go![.][A]
[0B31]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x125][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x113][OpenMidRight]General Duessel.[A][OpenMidLeft]Cormag![.][A]
You're[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]here[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]I turned my back on Grado to
avenge my murdered brother.[.][A]
I never imagined I'd see you
abandon Grado's army, though.[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]Circumstance has made[.]
me a traitor, it seems.[.][A]
It's ironic. Two men who threw away[.]
their country, riding side by side.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Mm.[.][A]
General Duessel, I would consider it
an honor to serve under you again.[A][OpenMidLeft]No, I'm a man with no country.
I'm no longer a general of Grado.[.][A][OpenMidRight]And I'm the same. Really, when
you look at it, nothing's changed.[A]
Then I simply choose you as the[.]
man I ride with and protect.[A][OpenMidLeft]Cormag[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[0B32]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x104][OpenMidLeft]Princess Eirika,

If you're here[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]Prince Ephraim is safe as well.[.][A]
Princess Eirika, we will stop the[.]
remaining enemy soldiers here.[A]
Would you please take caution and[.]
think of your own safety?[.][A][OpenMidRight]Thank you, Seth.[A]
You've saved me so many times[.]
since the fall of Renais[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]It is my duty. Let's go,

That's natural.[.][A]

[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x10F][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x12C][OpenMidLeft]B-Brother.[A][OpenMidRight]Tana?[.]
Why are you here?[.][A]
I told you to remain at[.]
Castle Frelia.[A][OpenMidLeft]Don't talk to me like that.[.][A]
I'm a fully sworn knight
of Frelia, you know?[A]
I came all the way here[.]
with Prince Ephraim.[A][OpenMidRight]What? With that man?[A][OpenMidLeft]Brother!
Ephraim's a good person.[A]
We can talk about this later.[.]
I still see enemy troops about.[.][A]
I think we should join forces[.]
and fight together.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Working together is, of course,[.]
the best strategy.[A]
But don't do anything foolish, Tana.
Who knows what Father would think.[A][OpenMidLeft]I understand.[.][A]
You try not to be overly
heroic yourself, Brother.[.][A]

I've done a lot of good[.]
work, Teacher.[A][OpenMidRight]Is that so[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
Well, if you all hadn't shown[.]
up, I'm sure we'd be dead now.[A]
You've saved us, Ewan. Thank
you. I am in your debt.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Do you mean that?[.][A]
As a reward, will you teach[.]
me some more powerful magic?[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]I suppose I should at that.[.]
But all in good time, Ewan.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Yahoo![A]

So desolate?[A][OpenMidRight]Spies report that the castle is[.]
being held by the traitor Orson.[A][LoadOverworldFaces][OpenLeft]Orson[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
In retrospect, I realize he's[.]
been acting odd for a while now.[A]
He seemed so[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]dispirited.[.][A][OpenMidRight]His wife passed away some six[.]
months back.[A]
The loss may have been too much[.]
for his mind to bear.[.][A]
His love and devotion for his wife
were well known among the knights.[A][OpenFarLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]Now, he sits alone in the king's
former bedchambers.[.][A]
He makes no effort to govern.[.][A]
No one is allowed to enter the
chambers, and he takes no meals.[A][OpenFarLeft]What could he possibly be doing?[A][OpenMidRight]I do not know. The spies had no[.]
insight into his behavior.[A]
He does nothing to deal with the dark[.]
creatures and bandits roaming the land.[.][A]
Reports say all of Renais is engulfed[.]
in chaos.[.][A]
Region after region is revolting, and[.]
Orson's reign is already crumbling.[.][A]
Left alone, it may very well collapse[.]
under the weight of its own neglect.[A][OpenLeft]We cannot allow the situation[.]
to reach that point.[A][CloseSpeechSlow][OpenLeft]We're going home, Eirika.[.]

The Stones of Grado, Frelia, and
Jehanna are gone, but hope is not.[A]
We have the Stone of Renais, after
all, and that of Rausten is safe.[.][A]
Our road is clear, my friends.
I must guide you to Rausten.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Lead the way, L'Arachel.[A][OpenRight][ToggleSmile]Of course. And you will all be

[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x150][OpenLeft][LoadFace][0x12D][OpenFarLeft][LoadFace][0x12E][SendToBack][OpenFarLeft]How do you intend to use the
Sacred Stone, Lyon?[.][A]
Do you really think you can[.]
tap into its power?[.][A][OpenMidRight]Mm[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]My research isn't complete yet,[.]
but there's no mistaking the power[A]
the Sacred Stones contain.[A]
And the Stone of Grado seems especially[.]
responsive to my dark magic.[A]
I suppose it's because it contains
both sacred and demonic properties.[.][A]
Regardless, if I can just press[.]
my studies a little harder[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
Well, I think I might be able to use
it to heal my father's illness.[.][A]
If that works, there's no telling how[.]
many other people I can help as well.[.][A][OpenLeft]Do you think this is wise?[A]
The power contained within the stones[.]
is beyond our understanding[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
My father tells me that the stones
possess a power not to be trifled with.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Uh-huh[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
Father MacGregor is also against it.[A]
That's why they still won't give me[.]
direct access to the Stone of Grado.[A]
For the time being, I've made do with[.]
the radiant energies surrounding it.[A]
They're nothing compared to the raw[.]
power of the stone itself, but[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
If I can show Father MacGregor some[.]
real progress, perhaps one day[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenFarLeft]Using the Sacred Stones to
study magic[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]Ephraim, Eirika, what do you
two think?[A]
Using the divine power of the[.]
Sacred Stones in this way[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
You don't think it's a very[.]
good idea, do you?[A][OpenFarLeft][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]It's just that I know nothing[.]
at all of magic.[A]
I would that there were some way I
could help you, but I simply can't.[.][A][Clear]
But, Lyon, I've seen how hard you've
worked to help others.[A]
I know how much you want the power
to make others happy.[.][A]
I know these things, and because I
know you, I trust your intentions.[A][OpenMidRight]Ephraim[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenFarLeft]If you hope to use the power of the[.]
Sacred Stone for good, I trust you can.[.][A]
I'm behind you all the way.[.][A][OpenLeft]I agree with Ephraim entirely.[A]
You spend every night in the library,[.]
studying cures for your father's illness.[.][A]
The power of the Sacred Stones is too[.]
powerful to be used for personal gain.[A]
But you, Lyon[.][ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]I think you'll be[.]
fine. You're the kindest person I know.[.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Thanks, both of you.[A]
Hearing those words from you means a
lot to me.[A]
[ToggleSmile]Actually[ToggleMouthMove]--[ToggleMouthMove]and this hasn't been made[.]
public yet[ToggleMouthMove]--[ToggleMouthMove]but[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
I've already saved someone using the
knowledge I've gleaned so far.[A][OpenFarLeft]You have?[.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Uh-huh[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
A while back, a fire ravaged Serafew, and[.]
a little girl got trapped in the flames.[A]
Her burns were terrible: not even healing[.]
staves were able to cure her injuries.[A]
But just a sliver of the stone's power
restored her life and healed her wounds.[A]
We saved that girl's life, Ephraim![.][A]
Oh, if you could have seen the tears
of joy in her mother's eyes![A][ToggleSmile][ToggleSmile][OpenFarLeft]You really did it, huh?[.]
You are special, Lyon.[A]
Congratulations![A][OpenMidRight]Well[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]thanks. But there's still so
much more to be done.[.][A][Clear]
I am happy, though. To be honest, I[.]
just want to be able to help people.[A]
I want to put the ancient magics to[.]
use for the common good[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
That's how I feel.[A][OpenLeft]Lyon[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]And as my research moves forward,[.]
I'll be able to do much more, too.[A]
We have only the barest understanding[.]
of how dark magic operates.[.][A]
Maybe we can use it not only to heal
wounds, but also to stop diseases[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
What if we can read the future,[.]
predict disasters, move mountains!?[.][A][OpenLeft]Hold on, Lyon. You can't take too[.]
much on yourself all at once.[.][A]
What good is helping people if
you sacrifice yourself to do it?[A][OpenMidRight]Oh[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]Yes, of course. Sorry.
I got carried away.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenFarLeft]You have a soft heart, Lyon.[A]
I bet you haven't taken any[.]
real time off at all.[.][A][Clear]
So this is what we're going to do.
Today, we're going into the city.[.][A]
And you're going with us, Lyon.[.][A][OpenMidRight]What?[.][A]
But, Ephraim, you've got a
history report due.[.][A][OpenFarLeft]We're taking today off.[.]
C'mon, let's go.[A][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x150][OpenMidRight]Bu-but, Ephraim[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenLeft]It's just one day, and I won't tell[.]
anyone.[.][A]
Won't it be fun for the three of us[.]
to spend a day in the city?[.][A][OpenMidRight]Ephraim, Eirika[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
Thanks so much.[.][A]

Vidofnir, the Winged Lance.[.][A]
I want you to take them.[A][OpenMidLeft]These are for you, aren't they?[.]
They're for the rulers of Frelia.[.][A][OpenMidRight]No, I entrust them to your care.[A]
You're the leader of this army.[.]
Use them as you see fit.[A][OpenMidLeft]Thank you, Prince Innes[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
I appreciate your sacrifice.[A][OpenMidRight]It is no sacrifice, and[.]
I require no thanks.[A]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x114][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x10F][OpenMidRight]Ephraim.[A][OpenMidLeft]Innes?[A][OpenMidRight]There's no need to panic. The soldiers
are following Prince Lyon's trail.[A]
Our trackers are excellent.[.]
They'll know his whereabouts momentarily.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Ah[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]Good point. Well made.[A][OpenMidRight]By the way, there's something I need
to speak with you about.[A]
The messenger I sent to Frelia
returned not long ago.[A]
She brought a package I'd requested:
Frelia's Sacred Twins.[A][OpenMidLeft]You have the Sacred Twins?[A][OpenMidRight]Yes. Frelia may have lost her[.]
Sacred Stone[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
However, it seems the Sacred Twin[.]
relics remained undisturbed.[A]
I had them brought here.
Behold![.][A][OpenMidLeft]Incredible[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]Frelia's Sacred Twins.[A]
Nidhogg, the Serpent Bow, and[.]
Vidofnir, the Winged Lance.[.][A]
I want you to take them.[A][OpenMidLeft]But these are Frelia's weapons.[.]
You should hold on to them.[.][A][OpenMidRight]No, I entrust them to you.[A]
You're the leader of this army.[.]
Use them as you will.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Understood. I'll make sure they[.]
wind up in worthy hands.[A]
Thank you, Innes. This helps.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Don't thank me.[.][A]

Very well. I'm yours to[.]

[0B7A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x102][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x122][OpenMidLeft]L'Arachel[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
May I ask your advice?[A][OpenMidRight]What is it, Eirika?[.]
There's no need to be so formal.[A][OpenMidLeft]It's about Lyon[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][Clear]
My brother was right. Lyon's been[.]
possessed by the Demon King.[A]
He[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]He's no longer the Lyon[.]
I once knew.[A]
But I can't help feeling[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]there[.]
must be some way to bring him back.[.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft][MoveMidLeft][OpenMidLeft]Please help me, L'Arachel.
I want to save him.[.][A]
Rausten is the spiritual heart of[.]
Magvel. They keep the ancient lore.[.][A]
You're their princess. You must know
something about the demons of legend.[.][A]
Is there anything that can save Lyon?[.][A][LoadOverworldFaces][OpenMidRight]I'm so sorry, Eirika.[.][A]
To the best of my knowledge,
there is no way to aid him.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]That can't be![A]
There must be something!
Any clue, no matter how slight[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][LoadOverworldFaces][OpenMidRight]Our oldest legends tell us just this[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
Only one person has ever been able to[.]
shake off the Demon King's domination.[A]
Rausten's founder, Saint Latona the[.]
sure-hearted, shattered his fetters.[A]
If one possesses a strength of will[.]
beyond that of normal men[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
Only then can one throw off the[.]
shackles of the Demon King.[.][A][Clear]
But you saw it for yourself, Eirika,
with your own two eyes.[.][A]
Your friend Lyon's body has already[.]
been claimed by the Demon King.[.][A]
Once it's gone that far, [.][.....]there's[.]
nothing that can be done.[.][A]
When the Demon King takes over someone,[.]
he devours his spirit, his very soul.[.][A]
Even if his hold on Lyon's body could be
released, that body would have no soul.[.][A]
There is no power in Rausten[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]not[.]
even the Sacred Stone[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
that can perform so great a miracle[.]
as to restore a shattered soul.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]But[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
Lyon[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]Eirika[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
I understand how you feel,
but the prince is gone.[.][A]
The Lyon you knew no longer[.]
exists.[.][A][Clear]
It's more important now that
you care for yourself.[A]
If we pursue the Demon King,
we're likely to suffer for it.[A]
I want you to return to Rausten[.]
Palace and rest yourself.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Thank you, L'Arachel.[.][A]
However, I must stay with[.]
the company.[A]
I have to believe there's something[.]
I can do to help him.[.][A]
Lyon was always so kind. He wanted
nothing more than to help people.[.][A]
It's too terrible to picture him
imprisoned by the Demon King.[.][A]
Imprisoned[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]with no hope
of salvation.[.][A]
[0B7B]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x114][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x122][OpenMidRight]E-Ephraim. I must ask[.]
that you slow down![.][A]
If you travel so swiftly,[.]
we cannot keep up.[A][OpenMidLeft]I'm riding ahead. I can't[.]
waste any more time.[A]
I must catch the Demon King[.]
as quickly as possible.[.][A][OpenMidRight]And when you find him?
Tell me, what then?[.][A][LoadOverworldFaces][OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A][Clear]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]L'Arachel.[A]
Rausten is the spiritual heart of[.]
Magvel. They keep the ancient lore.[.][A]
You're their princess. You must know
something about the demons of legend.[.][A]
I do not need consolation or peace of[.]
mind. I need facts.[.][A][Clear]
Lyon, as he is now[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
Can he be saved?[A][OpenMidRight]I'm sorry[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
To the best of my knowledge,
there's nothing to be done.[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A][LoadOverworldFaces][OpenMidRight]Your friend Lyon's body has already[.]
been claimed by the Demon King.[.][A]
Once it's gone that far, [.][.....]there's[.]

When the Demon King takes over someone,[.]

There is no power in Rausten[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]not[.]
even the Sacred Stone[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
that can perform so great a miracle[.]
as to restore a shattered soul.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Is that so[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
I understand.[.]
Let's go, L'Arachel.[A][OpenMidRight]W-wait a moment. Hmph!
Were you listening to me at all?[A]
I'm sorry, but the prince[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]I heard you.[A]
There's no hope of saving Lyon.[.][A]
And if I cannot save him[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
I will bring him peace with my
own hands.[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
But[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
Can you do it?[A]
Even if you get the chance, can[.]
you bring yourself to kill him?[.][A]
It would be best if you and your
sister left this to the rest of us.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]No[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]I'm going to do it.[.][A]
Lyon is my friend.[A]
The Demon King stole him from me.[.]
I will be the one to kill him.[A][OpenMidRight]If your mind's made up, there's[.]
not much I can do, is there?[A]
Let's go then.[A][OpenMidLeft]I'm sorry, L'Arachel.[.][A][OpenMidRight]There's no need for you[.]
to apologize.[.][A]
Your words alone have[.]
won my forgiveness.[.][A]

Lyon is no longer part of your

I have devoured every last

What does it matter what happens to[.]

He was my friend.[.][A]

I made a promise to him.[A][Clear]

You're the Demon King[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]

I had a vision. A vision
of the future of Magvel.[A]
I saw myself standing with two
roads stretched out before me.[A]
One led to the Demon King,
devouring both my body and soul.[A]
The other showed me the power to
fight the Demon King's dominion.[A]
And I, well[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][CloseSpeechSlow][OpenMidRight][MoveMidRight][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]Gaa[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]urgh.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Lyon![.][A][OpenMidRight]Then I acquired the Dark Stone.[.][A]
The Demon King began to eat my
soul and corrupt my flesh.[A]
I almost vanished beneath[.]
the Demon King's mantle.[A]
Then I remembered you[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
My mind blazed into wakefulness.[A]
All at once, my mind shouted
out, [OpenQuote]I will not be devoured![CloseQuote][A]
Just as I was about to lose[.]
myself to the Demon King,[.][A]
I was able to drive him back.[.][A]
The Demon King's desires are
simple[ToggleMouthMove]--[ToggleMouthMove]foul, but uncomplicated.[A]
He wants nothing but the destruction,[.]
conquest, and subjugation of man.[.][A]
Those shallow desires are nothing[.]
to the dreams of the human heart.[.][A][Clear]
And of the two roads I had seen,
I chose the latter.[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]But I didn't want to appear before
you here in the role of Lyon.[.][A]
Lyon, the piteous victim[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
The Demon King, the fiendish villain[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
It was all an act[.][ToggleMouthMove]--[ToggleMouthMove]high drama for you
all, to suit this grand occasion.[.][A][Clear]
That's right, Ephraim.[A]
I'm the Demon King[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
The Demon King is me.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]You lie[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
It can't be. It's not possible.[.][A]
Lyon was[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]My friend was kind
and caring[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
He was a good person[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
But you[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
You are not that person![A][OpenMidRight]Ephraim[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]You[.][ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]You're the Demon King.
Lyon is gone, and you are a liar![.][A]
You're trying to trick me.
You're trying to confuse me![A][Clear]
I'm right, aren't I?! Tell me[.]
I'm right, Lyon! TELL ME![.][A][OpenMidRight][MoveFarRight][OpenFarRight]I'm sorry, Ephraim.[.][A][Clear]
Ephraim, listen to me.[A]
Ten days from now[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
When the moon is swallowed by shadow[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
In Darkling Woods, I will perform[.]
a ceremony[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
Through this ceremony, I will[.]
gain immense power.[.][A]
Power to change not only Grado,[.]
but the entire world.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Change[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]the world?[A][OpenFarRight]But after that[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
I cannot save myself.[.][A]
I'll become the Demon King of old[.]
and try to destroy all of mankind.[A]
Ephraim. If you want to stop this,
you must come to Darkling Woods.[A]
I want you to come. I need you to[.]
stop me. You must promise.[A]

You look ill.[.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]Is that you, Eirika?[A]
Don't worry.
It's nothing.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]B-but[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]you're so pale.[.][A]
What happened?[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]Eirika.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Y-yes?[A][OpenMidRight]Lyon is[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
Lyon's my friend.[.][A]

Let's get out of here. L'Arachel

fled over this cliff.[.][A][OpenFarRight]I see no way we can[.]
pursue him now[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenRight]So he got away, is that it?[.][A][OpenLeft]There's no cause to be discouraged.[.][A]
Beyond these mountains lie the heart
of Darkling Woods.[A]
Before we enter, we must head north[.]
to Rausten.[.][A]
After all, we still need the
Sacred Stone of Rausten.[A]
As long as even one stone remains,
all hope is not lost.[.][A]
Come on. We cannot give in to despair[.]
when victory draws so near![.][A]
[0B8B]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x122][OpenMidRight]Home at last.[.][A]
My dear, sweet palace.[A][CloseSpeechSlow][OpenMidRight]Uncle, I've returned.[.][A][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x153][OpenMidLeft]Oh, L'Arachel! It's good
to see you safe![A][OpenMidRight]Of course I'm safe, Uncle.[A]
Evil can never defeat the[.]
forces of righteousness![A][OpenMidLeft]Ha! You're exactly right, my dear![A]
Now tell me, who are our guests?[A]
[0B8C]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x153][OpenFarRight][LoadFace][0x114][OpenRight][LoadFace][0x102][SendToBack][OpenRight]Pontifex Mansel of Rausten, allow[.]
me to introduce myself.[.][A]
I am Eirika, Princess of Renais.[A]
I come to you today as an[.]
emissary of Frelia.[.][A][OpenFarRight]And I am Ephraim, Prince of Renais.[.][A]
I come with Eirika to warn you of[.]
the danger our world faces.[.][A][CloseSpeechSlow][OpenRight]It began when[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[0B8D]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x122][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x153][OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]Hmm, I see.[.][A]
That is a tough tale to swallow[.]
all at once[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
However, I have heard of the fell[.]
creatures in Darkling Woods.[A]
L'Arachel.[A]
You will need the Stone of Rausten
if we have any hope of victory.[.][A][OpenMidRight]That is so, Uncle.[A]
I would like permission[.]
to open the temple seal.[A][OpenMidLeft]Hmm[.][ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]There's no need to
rush yourself so, L'Arachel.[A]
You're home again, in this
blessed haven. You should rest.[.][A][OpenMidRight]How can I relax until I know that[.]
our Sacred Stone is safe?[.][A]
At the least, I'd like to ensure
that the temple seal is intact.[.][A]
Oh[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]Is something amiss?[.][A][OpenMidRight]I think we'll take a night to rest
after all. Everyone is so exhausted.[A]
My dear friend Eirika especially has
had a very trying time of late.[.][A]
[0B8E]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x102][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x122][OpenMidLeft][HalfCloseEyes][OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]Eirika.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Ah[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]Don't look so sad. It wreaks
such havoc on your beauty.[A][OpenMidLeft]L'Arachel. I[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
What should I do?[.][A][CloseSpeechSlow][LoadOverworldFaces][OpenMidLeft]Lyon was one of my dearest
friends[.][ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]I feel so helpless.[.][A]
There's nothing I can do to[.]
help him[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]Your friend is gone, Eirika.[A]
All that remains is the Demon[.]
King, masquerading as Lyon.[.][A]
For the good of all humanity,[.]
he must be defeated.[A]
Ah[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]If only it truly were[.]
that easy, though.[A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]Eirika[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
I never knew Prince Lyon.[.][A]
I cannot pretend to understand
the sadness you must feel.[A]
However, I do know this[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
If the Lyon you hold so dear
were here with you today[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
What do you think he would
want you to do?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]I can't[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]There's no need to rush, Eirika.[A]
Take your time and think it through.
You need to find your own answer.[.][A]
Now then, it's about time we found
ourselves something to eat.[.][A]
It's hard to be optimistic on an
empty stomach.[A][OpenMidLeft][OpenEyes][OpenMidLeft]Yes, I'll be right there.[.][A]
Thank you, L'Arachel.[.][A]
[0B8F]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x114][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x12C][OpenMidLeft][HalfCloseEyes][OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]Come on, Ephraim, cheer up.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]What are you talking about, Tana?[.][A]
There's nothing wrong with
me. I'm always like this.[.][A][OpenMidRight]That's not true.[A]
I've never seen you look so[.]
sad as you do right now.[A]
If you're depressed, I'm sure[.]
my brother would worry[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
And I[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]well, I[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][LoadOverworldFaces][OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
Tana. You're the princess of Frelia.[A]
Perhaps it's unwise of you to be so[.]
friendly to Eirika and me.[A]
After all, alliances aside, our two[.]
countries' needs may differ.[A]
Who knows what the future holds? Those
ties could snap in an instant[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]No! Don't say that![.][A][OpenMidLeft]And why not?[A][OpenMidRight]You and Eirika are both my friends.[.][A]
We come from different countries,[.]
it's true, but[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]but[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
No matter what happens, the friendship
I feel for you will never change![.][A][OpenMidLeft][OpenEyes][OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
I'm sorry, Tana.[A]
I wasn't thinking straight.[.]
Please don't cry.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Ephraim[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]You're right, though.[.][A]
No matter what happens, the bond
between us will never disappear.[A]
And it's because Lyon is my friend[.....]
that I have to put an end to this.[A]
Thank you, Tana.[A]

Has something happened?[.][A][OpenMidRight]L'Arachel[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
No, this is how I always am.[A][OpenMidLeft]Lying to the daughter of a holy[.]
man is a grave sin, don't you know?[.][A]
If you would like to talk, I would
like to listen[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][LoadOverworldFaces][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
I'm sorry.
I can't talk about it.[A]
I'm not even planning on telling
Eirika what happened.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]You're so stubborn, aren't you?[.][A]
Do you plan on shouldering the
entire burden yourself?[.][A][OpenMidRight]I'm sorry.[A][OpenMidLeft]If that's all you're going to say,
then there's naught I can do.[.][A]
Have you already decided on your
course of action?[.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
Mm-hm. I'm prepared.[A][OpenMidLeft]Well[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][Clear]
Then there's no need for me to
say anything more, is there?[A]
You and I are so alike[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
You want nothing but to help others.[A]
You refuse to show weakness, and you
want to accomplish everything yourself.[.][A]
However, you must know that there are[.]
times when you must share the burden.[.][A][OpenMidRight][OpenEyes][OpenMidRight]That's true[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
And I feel better for having spoken[.]
with you. Thank you, L'Arachel.[.][A]

However, they've breached the palace
defenses at multiple points.[A][OpenLeft]What?![A][OpenMidRight]The imperial guard is at a terrible[.]
disadvantage of numbers right now.[A]
It's less a battle than a slaughter.[A]

out until the Knights of Rausten arrive.[A][OpenLeft]How has this happened?[A]

Father![.][A][OpenMidRight]Lyon[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
This is[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]the end for me.[.][A]
From now on[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]you[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenLeft]Don't say that, Father.[.][A][OpenMidRight]You must concern yourself[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
with Grado[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
The people[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]our people
must be saved[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
Lyon[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]tell me again.
What will happen to Grado?[A][OpenLeft]I have seen it many times now, as[.]
have the court mages.[.][A]
It's the same every time, Father.[.]
It's always the same.[.][A]
Sometime in the coming years, the[.]
southern continent will collapse.[.][A]
Countless people will die instantly.
Those who don't will likely starve.[.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenLeft]None but the mages and I know of
the vision, as you ordered.[.][A]
But[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]if we don't do something,[.]
all of those people will die.[.][A]
Please tell me, Father.[.]
What should I do?[.][A]
What[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]Lyon[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
When I die[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
You will be emperor[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
The emperor[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
must protect his country.[.][A]
There is nothing more[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
that I can do.[A]
It's you[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]You must
protect our people.[.][A][OpenLeft]B-but, Father[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
I don't have the power[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
Ah![.]
R-Renais[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
If I ask Eirika and Ephraim for[.]
help, I'm sure they would[.][ToggleMouthMove]--[ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]You would ask Renais to rescue us[.]
from[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]a natural disaster?[.][A]
They would not help us[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
Grado's borders would overflow with[.]
starving refugees by the thousands.[.][A]
Renais would close her borders to[.]
us. It's only natural[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
Renais has a duty to protect herself.[.][A][OpenLeft]No, that would never[ToggleMouthMove]--[ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]Lyon[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
You are the one[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
who must[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]save our people.[A]
You must take my place[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
The citizens of Grado[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
are counting on[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]you[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenLeft]Father?![A]
No[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]wait![.][A]
I cannot do anything without
you, Father![A][CloseSpeechSlow][OpenMidRight][ClearFace][OpenLeft]Fa[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]Father[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenFarLeft]His Highness[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenLeft]I am[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]weak.[.][A]
Because I am weak[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]people will die.[A]
I[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[0BB8]
[OpenLeft][LoadFace][0x150][OpenFarLeft][LoadFace][0x12F][SendToBack][OpenFarLeft]Prince Lyon[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenLeft]Knoll[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
I[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
Open the seal on the
Sacred Stone of Grado.[A][OpenFarLeft]The Sacred Stone?[.]
But that's[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenLeft]You've seen the scrolls. You know there[.]
is a way to stop the coming disaster.[.][A]
If those scrolls are correct, the rites[.]
they describe can save all of Grado.[A]
But it will require a staggering amount[.]
of dark energy[ToggleMouthMove]--[ToggleMouthMove]and a sacrifice as well.[A]
The human body cannot contain the powers
these rites demand[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][Clear]
And yet[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
Of the five Sacred Stones, Grado's
alone possesses a greater power[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
It is the very prison housing the soul
of the ancient Demon King.[A]
If we could harness its power, well[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
If we can do that, we can avert[.]
disaster and save countless lives.[A][OpenFarLeft]But you forget[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenLeft]I forget nothing![.]
I know I am too weak.[.][A]
Because of me, all of Grado[.]
will be destroyed.[A]
I need[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
I need the Sacred Stone.[A]
I must become stronger.[.]
I will become stronger.[.][A]
[0BB9]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x146][OpenMidLeft]Everything is in readiness.[.][A]
The Stones have been destroyed.[.]
The Demon King's power swells.[A]
The Black Temple possesses all
the demonic power I will need.[A]
The rites can begin.[A]
All that remains is for me to[.]
sacrifice my life[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
The disaster will be averted.[.][A][Clear]
My people will be saved[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[0BBA]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x12D][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x150][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]When tomorrow comes[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
You have to go home, don't you?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Yes[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
Thank you for everything, Lyon.[.][A]
I'll never forget the time I
spent here.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Do you think we'll see each other again?[A][OpenMidLeft]Yes, of course.[.][A]
My brother and you and me. We are[.]
friends, after all. Aren't we?[A][OpenMidRight]Eirika[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
Yep, you're right.[A][OpenMidLeft]I hope your study of the Sacred[.]
Stones is fruitful.[.][A]
I know you'll use the wisdom you
glean to make your people happy.[A][OpenMidRight]Thank you, Eirika.[A]
You know, you're the only reason
I was able to save that girl.[.][A]
There were times when I wanted
to give up, to admit failure.[.][A]
But you were always there. You were[.]
always encouraging me to succeed.[.][A]
That's what kept me going. I just[.]
thought of you.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Lyon[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]Eirika[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
I[.][ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]I've always[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][CloseSpeechSlow][OpenMidRight]I'm sorry[.][ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]Forget what I was saying.[.][A]
I could never be like Ephraim[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]Lyon, what do you[.][ToggleMouthMove]--[ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]I guess this is it, Eirika.[.]
Hope to see you again someday.[A]
I'm going to focus on my work[.]
and do my best until that day.[A]
My research will progress, and my[.]
discoveries will benefit us all.[A]
One day, I will be a prince worthy
of you, and I will see you again.[.][A]
[0BBB]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x12E][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x150][OpenMidLeft]Don't make that face.[.][A]
We'll see each other again. All[.]
three of us[.][ToggleMouthMove]--[ToggleMouthMove]you, me, and Eirika.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]Yeah[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]I know.[.][A]
But when we get older, when we each[.]
take the reigns of our nations,[.][A]
we probably won't meet again[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]Not[.]
like this, I mean. Not as friends.[A][OpenMidLeft]What's that got to do with anything?[A]
Kings are humans, too. Emperors[.]
need not be friendless, you know.[.][A][OpenMidRight]I suppose you're right. You have a knack
for cutting to the heart of things.[.][A]
But becoming a king or an emperor is
not something you can take lightly.[.][A]
I really don't think we'll be the[.]
same people we are right now[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][Clear]
What if Renais and Grado went to war?[.]
What if we were forced to fight?[A][OpenMidLeft]Don't be ridiculous.
That would never happen.[A][OpenMidRight]If[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
If it did[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
We'd still be friends,
wouldn't we?[A][OpenMidLeft]Even if that happens, yes.[A]
We're friends forever. Nothing
can change that. You'll see.[A][OpenMidRight]Hm[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
All right, Ephraim.[.][A][Clear]
Then I will see you again.[A]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x102][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x146][OpenMidLeft]Lyon![.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
Eirika?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Lyon[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]It is you, isn't it, Lyon?![.][A][OpenMidRight]Yes[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
But I'm[.][ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]I'm almost
completely gone.[A][CloseSpeechSlow][OpenMidRight]Before I'm lost entirely,[.]
I want to apologize.[A]
I'm sorry, Eirika.
This is all my fault.[.][A]
I was too weak[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]You're not to blame, Lyon.[A]
It was the Demon King. He[.]
was controlling you[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]No, that's not true, Eirika.[A]
When the Demon King reached into me[.]
from inside the Dark Stone[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
When he whispered he would see all my[.]
dreams and desires made true[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
I[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]I did not reject him.[.][A][CloseSpeechSlow][OpenMidRight]In the shadows of my heart, he saw
jealousy[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]vanity[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
It was my weakness that put these[.]
emotions there, allowed them to thrive.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Everyone has weaknesses, Lyon.[A]
You're not the only one. I do.
I'm sure my brother does[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
Don't hate yourself for having
these feelings, please.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Thank you, Eirika.[A]
You were always[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]so kind.[A][CloseSpeechSlow][OpenMidRight]The Demon King will claim my flesh as[.]
a vessel for his resurrection.[A]
Before that can happen[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
I want you to kill me.[A]
I'm sorry, Eirika. I'm already[ToggleMouthMove]--[ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[0BBD]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x102][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x14A][ToggleColorInvert][OpenMidRight]Oh, please[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
Are you done turning your failings into[.]
some sad epic of personal tragedy?[A]
It's time we started then.[A]
I have a ritual to complete[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
and some nuisances to kill.[.][A][ToggleColorInvert][OpenMidLeft]Shut your mouth.[A]
I won't allow you to desecrate
Lyon's body any further.[A]
You will not return to this world.
I will stop you myself if I must.[.][A][ToggleColorInvert][OpenMidRight]Ah, is that so? And do you honestly[.]
think yourself capable, wench?[A]
You once prayed for this fool's salvation.
Can you bring yourself to kill him?[.][A][ToggleColorInvert][OpenMidLeft]I can and I will.[.][A]
I made a promise to Lyon,[.]
and I intend to honor it.[.][A]
[0BBE]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x114][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x146][OpenMidLeft]Lyon.[.][A][OpenMidRight]You came after all, Ephraim.
I'm glad.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Lyon.[.][A]
Is this[.][ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]Is this my fault?[.][A]
Am I responsible for how
much you've changed?[A]
I haven't seen you for
two years now[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
Have you[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]hated me
that entire time?[.][A][OpenMidRight]No, Ephraim.[A]
I was never dishonest. I liked
you both. I still do.[.][A]
But I was envious of you, too.[A]
That's why I[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]desired this.[.][A]
You may not believe me when[.]
I tell you this, but[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
Even now, after all this, I[.]
still consider you a friend.[A][OpenMidLeft]Lyon[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][Clear]
You know that I do, too.
I spoke the truth to you[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
I truly thought that we[.]
would always be friends.[A][Clear]
That's why I[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
I have to stop you.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Of course. I know[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
You are Ephraim, after all.[.]
You could do no less, my friend.[A]
Well, come then, Ephraim.[.]
Try and stop me.[A]
I will defeat you, and then I[.]
will save the people of Grado.[A]
No one[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
No one will stand in my way.[A]
[0BBF]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102][OpenMidRight]Lyon[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]

I will defeat the Demon King.[.][A][OpenMidRight][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x14A][ToggleColorInvert][OpenMidLeft]Hah, do you really think your[.]
blade can hurt me?[A]

even hit me, that is.[.][A][ToggleColorInvert][OpenMidLeft][ClearFace]
[0BC0]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x146][OpenMidLeft]Tell me, Ephraim: do I look[.]
like I've grown stronger?[.][A]
The last time we dueled, I
was too weak to test you.[.][A]
Why, I was so weak, I even
lost to Eirika[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x114][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x146][OpenMidLeft]I've sacrificed the lives[.]
of many good people.[A]
I've committed many[.]
unforgivable sins.[A]
The caring heart I once[.]
possessed died long ago[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][Clear]

I've grown strong enough to[.]
defeat even you, Ephraim.[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x114][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]No, you haven't. You're[.]

In that ancient battle, it took the might[.]

We did not have their extraordinary[.]

My brother, he is a part of me[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
I cannot rest here in peace while[.]
he risks his life.[A][OpenMidLeft]No. Renais has no more army. Grado's
forces decimated it.[A]
I wish that Frelia could provide you
with support, with soldiers, but[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][Clear]
My son, Innes, is on his way to[.]
meet the empire's forces.[.][A]
We cannot spare a single brigade.[.][A]
Your own retinue of knights cannot
possibly face Grado alone.[A]
Are you so determined to go?[A][OpenRight]Yes.[A]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]With apologies.[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]As resolute as your father, eh?[.][A]
What am I to do in the face of such[.]
foolhardy determination?[A]
Vanessa.[A][OpenFarRight][ClearFace][OpenFarRight][LoadFace][0x108][OpenFarRight]Here, Your Highness![A][OpenMidLeft]Moulder.[A][OpenFarRight][ClearFace][OpenFarRight][LoadFace][0x107][OpenFarRight]You called, my king?[A][OpenMidLeft]You are to accompany Princess Eirika of[.]
Renais into Grado territory.[A]
I expect each of you to provide[.]
aid and support for her brother.[A][OpenFarRight][LoadFace][0x107][OpenFarRight]Hmm, quite a grave responsibility[.]
you've given us.[A][OpenFarRight][ClearFace][OpenFarRight][LoadFace][0x108][OpenFarRight]No matter the obstacles, we will
perform our duty.[.][A][OpenFarRight][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft]These are some of my most trusted[.]
and stalwart vassals.[.][A]
They will, no doubt, prove themselves[.]
quite valuable on your journey.[.][A][Clear]
Remember, you are venturing behind
enemy lines. You will need supplies.[A]
I will have a supply convoy readied to
carry your weapons and provisions.[A][Clear]
It will remain at your side, no matter
how far afield you venture.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenRight]King Hayden, I[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
Thank you.[A][OpenMidLeft]No, save your thanks for your return[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]

[0C01]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x102][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x12C][OpenMidRight]Eirika, you don't really intend[.]
to go through with this, do you?[A]
I can't guess how you must feel,
but it's just too dangerous.[A]
What would happen if you were[.]
captured by Grado's men?[A][OpenMidLeft]Thank you for your concern, Tana.[.][A]
But I have no choice. Don't you[.]
see, Tana? I have to go.[A][OpenMidRight]Eirika[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
Oh, why is this happening? What's[.]
gone wrong with the world?[A][OpenMidLeft]Tana[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]Why would Grado invade?[.][A]
Emperor Vigarde is a man of peace.
His people adore him.[.][A]
And you and Ephraim are friends[.]
with Prince Lyon, are you not?[A]
What could be behind this madness?
Why is this happening[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]I have no answers for you, Tana.[A]
I don't want to believe it, but the[.]
reality is that we are at war.[A]
If I do nothing, I may lose my
brother as well as my father.[.][A]
This is why I have to fight.
It's the only answer I have.[A]
[0C02]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x102][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x114][OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]What is it, Eirika?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]I was thinking about Lyon.[A]
The last time we saw him was
a year and a half ago[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]You're right.[.]
It was at Grado Keep.[.][A]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]Has it really been only a[.]
year and a half?[A]
[0C03]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x12D][OpenFarFarLeft][LoadFace][0x150][OpenMidRight]Ephraim! Lyon![A]
Where are you two?[A][OpenFarFarLeft]We're over here, Eirika.[A]
You'd better be quick. Ephraim
says he's tired of waiting.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Oh, please. I'm sure you could
wait a few moments longer[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[0C04]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x150][OpenRight][LoadFace][0x12D][OpenFarRight][LoadFace][0x12E][SendToBack][OpenFarRight]You're late. How does it take you so long[.]
to prepare for such a simple trip?[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Rest easy, Ephraim. There's no need[.]
to be so curt with your own sister.[.][A]
After all, a king must learn to treat[.]
women with honor and discretion.[A]
That's what Father MacGregor says.[A][OpenRight]Thank you, Lyon. You, unlike my dear
brother, are a true gentleman.[A][ToggleSmile][CloseSpeechSlow][OpenRight]I was up far too late thinking about
my prayer to the temple flame last night.[.][A]
And I'm afraid I[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]I overslept[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenFarRight]Your prayer? What are[.]
you babbling about?[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Come now, you know that flame has been
burning since the time of darkness ended.[.][A]
You must know the story that the flame
will answer the prayers of any pilgrim![.][A][OpenFarRight]Really? I didn't know that[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenRight]Oh, Ephraim[.][ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]Father MacGregor is going to
scold you for neglecting your studies so.[.][A][OpenFarRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]Don't even joke about that.[.][A]
So tell us, what have you decided to
pray for, Eirika?[.][A][OpenRight]I, uh[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
It's a secret.[A][OpenFarRight]I should've known.
You're so boring.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Well, how about you, Ephraim?[.][A][OpenFarRight]Me? Let's see[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][Clear]
I guess I'll pray to become[.]
a stronger fighter.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]That's just like you, Ephraim.[A][OpenRight]Just like you indeed, Brother.[A][OpenFarRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]I can never tell if you're
complimenting me or mocking me.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Praising you, of course!
Right, Eirika?[A][OpenRight]Hee hee[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
Yes, that's right.[A][OpenFarRight]And you, Lyon?
What will you pray for?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]What? Me?[.][A]
Hm[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][Clear]
I suppose all I really want is
for all our people to be happy.[.][A][OpenFarRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]That's very, uh[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
That's very much like you.[A][OpenRight]Very much so, Lyon.[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]Now, I'm the one who cannot tell
if he's being praised or[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenFarRight]You're being praised, as always, Lyon.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenRight]Tell me, why the sudden decision to visit[.]
the temple?[.][A]
Did my brother do something again?[A][OpenFarRight]Now listen, you[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]Oh no. It's not what Ephraim's done.
It's what he hasn't done.[.][A]
He's learned nothing at all about the[.]
Sacred Stones and the temple flame, so[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenFarRight]Father MacGregor became angry.[A]
He said, [OpenQuote]One destined to become
king and rule over a nation[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
must know the history of his kingdom
and must respect the Sacred Stones.[CloseQuote][A]
Ever since I came to Grado, my life has[.]
been chastisement and castigation.[A]
Father MacGregor does not think me
to be altogether too[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]kingly.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]And yet General Duessel has nothing[.]
but praise for you, Ephraim.[A]
He says you're brave and true, that[.]
you've the makings of a great king.[.][A][OpenFarRight]A great king?[.][A][CloseSpeechSlow][OpenFarRight]I honestly have no idea what that means.[A]
Eirika should succeed the throne.[.][A]
I would be happy simply taking my lance[.]
and traveling the land as a mercenary.[A][OpenRight]Ephraim, that is nothing but foolish,[.]
irresponsible romanticism![A]
Do you realize how much your words would
fill Father's heart with grief?[.][A][OpenFarRight]Are we speaking of the same man? Our
father will likely outlive us all.[A]
For now, I'm content just learning
the lance from General Duessel.[.][A][CloseSpeechSlow][OpenFarRight]What about you, Lyon? Is there
anything you want to do?[A][OpenMidLeft]Me? Well, I[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
I suppose I want to become
like my father.[.][A][OpenRight]You were born to be the Emperor[.]
of Grado, Lyon. It suits you.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]No, I don't think so.[.]
I'm not[.][ToggleMouthMove]--[ToggleMouthMove][A][CloseSpeechSlow][OpenMidLeft]One thing I do know from watching my
father is that being emperor is hard.[.][A]
Every day, he answers the complaints of the[.]
people, and he almost never sleeps[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
My father is always so very tired.[A][Clear]
I hope one day that[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
I hope that I can help him.[.][A][OpenRight]Lyon[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]You are so honorable.[.][A]
You should learn from him, Brother.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenFarRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]Again with your criticism![A]
Tell me, Eirika. What say you to dressing[.]
like me and becoming king in my stead?[A]
You're so skinny, I doubt anyone would
notice you're not really a man.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Ha ha ha[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenRight][MoveRight][OpenRight]Ephraim![A]
[0C05]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x102][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x114][OpenMidLeft]What do you suppose Lyon is doing now?[A]
When Emperor Vigarde ordered the invasion[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
How do you think Lyon felt?[.][A][OpenMidRight]He's always been so gentle, but he worships[.]
his father. He'd never question him.[A][CloseSpeechSlow][OpenMidRight]But the emperor[.][ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]He's clearly not
behaving rationally.[A]
I just hope he's not so far gone that[.]
he'd hurt his own flesh and blood.[A][OpenMidLeft]I just pray for the day when the three
of us can be together once again.[.][A][OpenMidRight]It'll come. I've no doubt[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]

[ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x12C][OpenRight][LoadFace][0x114][OpenFarRight][LoadFace][0x102][SendToBack][OpenMidLeft]Eirika! Ephraim!

it's like a dream come true.[A]
You must know, I've prayed every
day for your safe return.[.][A][OpenFarRight]I'm so happy to see you, Tana.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenRight]I'm sorry, Tana. I didn't[.]
want for you to worry.[A][OpenMidLeft]Oh, it doesn't matter now[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
All that really matters is that[.]
we've been brought together again.[A]
My own brother will soon return[.]
from the field.[.][A]

safe and sound![.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenRight]You didn't expect less, did you?[A]
Do you think Grado's slugs could
touch me?[.][A][Clear]
With my bow, I'll take down every Grado[.]

I believe I warned you before.[A]
This happened because you provided
Grado the opportunity to strike.[A][OpenFarRight][LoadFace][0x12C][OpenFarRight]Brother! Mind your tongue! This is
no occasion for such harsh words.[.][A]
Ephraim and Eirika have lost their
father to this terrible war[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
I'm sorry to hear of
your father's death.[A][CloseSpeechSlow][OpenRight]Hear me, Ephraim.[.][A]
Our most important task is to[.]
defeat Grado and end this war.[A][OpenRight][ClearFace][OpenFarRight][MoveMidRight][OpenMidRight]Oh, Innes[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
I'm sorry, Eirika, Ephraim.[.][A][OpenLeft]It's all right. It's comforting to see that,
in all of this, at least he hasn't changed.[.][A]
Innes has hated me for as long as[.]
I can remember.[.][A][OpenMidRight]My brother looks upon you as a
rival, Ephraim.[.][A]
And as you know, he wants to be[.]
the best at everything.[.][A]
The best king, the best general,
the best fighter, the best man[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
He won't allow himself to be
beaten at anything[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenFarFarRight][LoadFace][0x10F][OpenFarFarRight]Tana, you talk too much.[A]

to tell him.[A][OpenFarLeft]It will be our honor to attend.[.][A][OpenMidRight]This way.[.][A]
[0C08]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x152][OpenMidLeft]It does my heart good to see you all
here safely within our castle walls.[A]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]Would that we had more time for[.]
pleasantries, but[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]let us hear your news.[A][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x10F][OpenMidRight]Very well, I will begin.[A][CloseSpeechSlow][OpenMidRight]I've directed the body of Frelia's army[.]
south to engage Grado directly.[.][A]
Our troops are proving themselves superior,[.]
and the battle progresses favorably.[A][OpenMidLeft]Hmm[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][Clear]
But the riddle still
needs answering.[A]
Why did Grado begin this
war in the first place?[.][A][OpenMidRight][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102][OpenMidRight]Your Majesty, we may well have found
something relating to that[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
We learned something on our travels,
news that weighs heavily upon us.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Ah, yes. Our messenger delivered
your report to us a few days ago.[.][A]
Grado is trying to destroy the
Sacred Stones[.][ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]Is that it?[.][A][OpenMidRight]Yes.[A][OpenMidLeft]We've strengthened the tower's defenses.
Frelia's stone is safe for the time being.[A][CloseSpeechSlow][OpenMidLeft]But we remain confused in this.[.][A]
What does Grado hope to gain by[.]
destroying the Sacred Stones?[.][A][OpenMidRight]We don't know. The legends say the stones[.]
protect us all from the power of darkness.[A][OpenMidRight][ClearFace][OpenRight][LoadFace][0x114][OpenFarFarRight][LoadFace][0x126][OpenRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]I can't say if it relates, but
I have a story about Grado.[.][A]

like to share it with you all.[A][CloseSpeechSlow][OpenRight]Myrrh. Come here, please.[.][A][OpenFarFarRight]Yes?[A][OpenFarFarRight][MoveFarRight][OpenMidLeft]Who's this girl?[A]

to an ancient race of dragon folk.[A]
They're mentioned in a few legends.[.]
They're called the tribe of Manakete.[.][A][OpenFarLeft]Manakete?[.][A][OpenLeft]Yes, their name appears several times[.]
in the tale of the Sacred Stones.[.][A]
It says they were neither human nor[.]
demon but a separate, aloof race.[.][A][OpenRight]Please, Myrrh.[A][OpenFarRight][LoadFace][0x128][OpenFarRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
We live in the east[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]in Darkling Woods.[A]
One day[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenFarLeft]Yes?[A][OpenFarRight]We felt something.[A]
An ominous energy to the south.[.][A][OpenRight]From the direction of Grado.[A]
They felt a[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]force flowing[.]
out of the Grado Empire.[A][OpenFarRight]Saleh and I[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
We went to investigate this energy.[.][A]
But on our way, we came across a battle[.]
and were drawn into the conflict[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenRight]Myrrh got lost and was wandering aimlessly
in an isolated region near Grado's border.[A][OpenFarRight]I met some wicked folk there. They
deceived me and enchained me.[.][A]
They stole my dragonstone. They[.]
were preparing me for transport.[A][CloseSpeechSlow][OpenFarRight]It was in that moment when Ephraim
appeared and rescued me.[A][OpenFarLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenRight]I stumbled across Myrrh by chance[.]
when Grado's men had ambushed us.[.][A]
Everything she told me seemed[.]
beyond belief, and yet[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][Clear]
And yet, when I saw her wings,
what could I do but believe?[A][OpenFarRight]This dark wave of energy still
flows from the southlands.[A]
Its current is strong and runs deep.
It has awakened the evil ones.[A]
I want to stop it.[A][OpenLeft]Hmmm[ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenFarRight][ClearFace][OpenFarRight][LoadFace][0x16F][LoadOverworldFaces][OpenFarRight]Your Majesty! I bring word![.][A][OpenLeft]What is so urgent you would[.]
interrupt a private council?[A][OpenFarRight]The tower holding the Sacred Stone

What of the soldiers on watch?
There were supposed to be many[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenFarRight]The enemy forces[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]

Only General Duessel is higher
in Emperor Vigarde's esteem[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
She's the one.[A][OpenLeft]She came personally[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
So they really do wish to see[.]
the Sacred Stones destroyed.[A]

Without the stone's[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]protection[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]

Still breathing, are you?[.][A]
Come. If you've any last words,[.]
I'll hear them, fool of Frelia.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]You[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]monster[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]You waste your last words on insults?[.]
And feeble ones, at that[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][Clear]
Hardly the right note to enter the eternal

[0C0C]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x13F][OpenMidRight]Hold![.][A]
What are you doing, Caellach?! Our
job was to destroy the Sacred Stone.[A][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x143][OpenMidLeft]I know that. And I crushed
it, did I not?[A]
But if we don't clean up these
Frelian curs, they might[ToggleMouthMove]--[ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]You do not raise your blade to anyone[.]
who is powerless to resist you![.][A]
The emperor does not desire us to kill
without cause! That would be murder![A][OpenMidLeft]Right, the emperor[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
Your name's Selena, ain't it?[.][A]
Tell me, Selena. What makes that pasty-[.]

His Imperial Majesty!?[A][OpenMidLeft]Hey, hey, I'm joking.[.]

[0C0D]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x152][OpenMidLeft]How could this happen[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
How could I have allowed our

Dark energies from the empire's capital[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
Evil monstrosities roaming our lands[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
Vigarde's mad invasion[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]And now this,[.]
the destruction of our sacred talisman.[.][A][Clear]
And we have no idea of Grado's goals.[.]
We are in dark times once again.[A]
But even so, we cannot sit here,
wringing our hands.[.][A][CloseSpeechSlow][OpenMidLeft]First, we must warn the nations that
house the remaining Sacred Stones.[A]
If Vigarde seeks to destroy the Stones,[.]
they are all in grave danger.[.][A]
Jehanna and Rausten must be warned.[.][A]

fight our common foe.[.][A][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102][OpenMidRight]Do you think they will believe us?[A][OpenMidLeft]Hm[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
It is a difficult tale to[.]

is not something they can ignore.[.][A]
I will travel to Jehanna, where I will
forge an alliance with her queen.[.][A]
If our Sacred Stone has been destroyed,[.]

Father, I cannot let you leave the nation[.]

It is imperative that I be the one to go.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Hmmm[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102][OpenMidRight]And I will head for Rausten.[A][OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x114][OpenMidLeft]Eirika?[.][A]
You know I can't let you put
yourself in such danger.[A][OpenMidRight]Rest easy, dear brother.[A]
I will journey to Rausten by ship across
the North Sea. There will be no danger.[.][A][CloseSpeechSlow][OpenMidRight]And I have made a vow.[A]

battle will turn to Grado's favor.[A]
There must be no errors. We must not fail.[A][OpenMidRight][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x10F][OpenMidRight]Where I command, there are
no mistakes.[A][OpenMidRight][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102][OpenMidRight]I have no doubts. I'll
succeed, I swear it.[A]
Come, it is time to go![.][A]
[0C0F]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x102][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x114][OpenMidLeft]Farewell, Brother.
I will return.[A][OpenMidRight]Mm[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][CloseSpeechSlow][OpenMidRight]To be honest, I still do
not want you to go.[.][A]
I would rather you wait[.]
here for my return.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Please, Ephraim[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
I will be fine. There's no
need for you to worry.[A]
Mine is the easiest task, 
and I'll be in no danger.[.][A][CloseSpeechSlow][OpenMidLeft]I'm far more worried about
your mission.[.][A]
Challenging the might of an[.]
empire with a handful of men?[.][A][OpenMidRight]What's this now? Have you[.]
lost your faith in me?[A][OpenMidLeft]No, of course not.[A]
I know your true strength, Ephraim.[.]
No one can defeat you.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]Ha ha! Hearing you say that[.]
fills me with confidence.[.][A][CloseSpeechSlow][OpenMidRight]I think I know my own limitations.[A]
I won't overextend my reach. I can't
die and leave you on your own, can I?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Ephraim[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]Let us both survive to be reunited.[.][A]
Give me your word, Eirika.[A][OpenMidLeft]You have it, Brother.[.][A]
[0C10]
[OpenFarRight][LoadFace][0x118][OpenFarRight]Princess Eirika![A][OpenRight][LoadFace][0x116][OpenRight]Is your departure time near?[A][OpenFarFarLeft][LoadFace][0x102][OpenFarFarLeft][MoveFarLeft][OpenFarLeft]Yes.[A]
Kyle, Forde, I'm traveling
to Rausten.[.][A]
I ask that you two serve
my brother well.[A][OpenRight]Actually, there's been a
slight change of plans.[.][A][OpenFarRight]We're going with you, Your Highness.[A][SendToBack][OpenFarLeft]What?[.]
But[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenFarRight]Prince Ephraim rides with[.]
Frelia's finest at his back.[A][OpenRight]And this was a personal order[.]
from the prince himself.[A]
He said, [OpenQuote]I don't need you loafing
around here. Go keep Eirika safe.[CloseQuote][A]
Since when is battling all of Grado[.]
loafing about? Honestly![A][OpenFarLeft]You're right! My brother's mission
is far more dangerous than mine.[A]
I will go and speak with him[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenFarRight]Princess Eirika.[A]
Prince Ephraim said he's not
concerned for his own safety.[.][A]
These are the words our prince gave[.]
us, and we believe he means them.[.][A][OpenRight]That's the truth of it.[.][A]
There's no cause for worry, Princess Eirika.
We can all attest to the prince's tenacity.[.][A]
No matter how close death comes, the Pale[.]
Horse will not catch him.[.][A][OpenFarLeft][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]Kyle, Forde[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][Clear]
I understand. Thank you for your
service and your bravery.[.][A]
You are my brother's most trusted[.]
and most valiant companions.[A]
I would be honored to have you
ride at my side.[A][OpenFarRight]The honor is ours.[A]
We ride for Renais and
for Princess Eirika![A][ToggleSmile][OpenRight]Let's not work ourselves into[.]
a frenzy right now.[.][A]
When the time comes, I will[.]
be there to handle things.[A][OpenFarLeft]Of course. I'm depending
on both of you.[.][A]
[0C11]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x118][OpenMidRight]Princess Eirika![A]
Are you ready to depart?[A][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x102][OpenMidLeft]I am, Kyle.[.][A]
I'm on my way to Rausten.[.][A]
I ask that you serve
my brother well.[A][OpenMidRight]Actually, milady, there's been a change[.]
of plans. I will be riding with you.[A][OpenMidLeft]What?[.]
But[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]Prince Ephraim rides with[.]
Frelia's finest at his back.[A]
I've been ordered to stay with
you and keep you safe.[A][OpenMidLeft]No, my brother is the one riding into[.]
combat. His road is far more perilous.[A]
I will go and speak to him[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]Lady Eirika.[A]
Prince Ephraim said he is not[.]
concerned for his own safety.[.][A]
I am not merely following orders.[.]
I believe his words. I believe him.[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]Kyle.[.][A][Clear]
I understand. Then I will[.]
believe as well.[A]
Kyle, you are my brother's most[.]
brave and trusted companion.[A]
I would be honored to have you
ride at my side.[A][OpenMidRight]The honor is mine.[A]
We ride for Renais and
for Princess Eirika![A]
[0C12]
[ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x116][OpenMidRight]Oh, Lady Eirika.
Are you ready to depart?[A][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x102][OpenMidLeft]I am, Forde.[A]
I'm on my way to Rausten.[.][A]
I ask that you serve
my brother well.[A][OpenMidRight]Actually, there's been a
slight change of plans.[.][A]
I believe I will ride with
you, milady.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]What?[.]
But[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]My apologies, but this was a personal[.]
order from the prince himself.[A]
He said, [OpenQuote]I don't need you loafing
around here. Go keep Eirika safe.[CloseQuote][A]
Since when is battling all of Grado[.]
loafing about? Honestly![A][OpenMidLeft]You're right! My brother's mission
is far more dangerous than mine.[A]
I will go and speak with him[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]There's no cause for worry, Lady Eirika.[A]
We know firsthand of the prince's[.]
tenacity.[.][A]
No matter how close death comes, the Pale[.]
Horse will not catch him.[.][A]
And while it's not the same as having me
with him, he does ride with Frelia's army.[A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]Forde.[A][Clear]
I understand[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]and I will believe
in him as you do.[.][A]
Forde, you are my brother's brave[.]
and trusted companion.[A]
I would be honored to have you
ride at my side.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]Let's just take things
nice and slow.[A]
When the time comes, I will[.]
be there to handle things.[A][OpenMidLeft]Of course. I'm depending
on you, Forde.[A]
[0C13]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x104][OpenMidRight]Prince Ephraim.[.][A][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x114][OpenMidLeft]Is that you, Seth?
I'm almost ready to depart.[.][A]
I'm leaving Eirika in your care.[A][OpenMidRight]Actually, milord[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
We have the honor of
riding with you.[A][OpenMidLeft]What?[.][A]
What about Eirika?[A][OpenMidRight]The princess informs me that she will[.]
be accompanied by a Frelian escort.[.][A]
She tells me she does not need a
large retinue on such a small ship.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]I understand, but we must be
prepared for anything.[A]
I will be fine, Seth. Please
go and attend Eirika.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Lord Ephraim, this is Lady Eirika's wish.[.][A]
She implored us to lend our blades to you[.]
on the front lines[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
She spoke to each of us individually. She[.]
knelt before us and beseeched us to go.[.][A]
Her sincerity, her concern[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]We could
not help but be moved by her plea.[A][OpenMidLeft]Oh, Eirika[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
Very well. You will all[.]
come with me.[.][A]
But steel yourselves. This will[.]
not be an easy journey.[.][A]
I want only volunteers who are
unafraid of meeting death.[A][OpenMidRight]I'll let the others know.[.][A]
I must tell you, milord[.][ToggleMouthMove]--[ToggleMouthMove]they are
already preparing to depart.[A]
They know the risks they are taking,
and not a one will be deterred.[.][A]
[0C14]
Eirika and Ephraim will now part ways.
Which of them will you accompany?[.][A]
[0C15]
Go with Eirika to Rausten.
[0C16]
Go with Ephraim to Grado.[.]
[0C17]
Will you go with Eirika?
[Yes]
[0C18]
Will you go with Ephraim?[.]
[Yes]
[0C19]
[ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x122][OpenMidLeft]It is time for me to be on my[.]
way, my friends.[A]
As the princess of Rausten, I still[.]
have many duties to perform.[A][CloseSpeechSlow][OpenMidLeft]Oh, Princess Eirika[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
If it please you, I would be ever so
delighted if you joined my tea club.[A]
I insist that you come. Oh, say you[.]
will, won't you?[A]
[0C1A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x12A][OpenMidLeft]I've much to do here in Jehanna.[A]
I'll start with what can be done
and keep going from there.[A]
First, I must talk to Mother.[.][A]
She should know that we've won,[.]
so that she can rest easily.[A]
[0C1B]
[ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x126][OpenMidLeft]Lady Eirika[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
I must return to Caer Pelyn[.]
and meet with the grand elder.[A]
I'm sure she is most worried
as well.[A]
But I was wondering[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
May I come to visit you from
time to time?[.][A]
[0C1C]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x10F][OpenMidLeft]We of Frelia will do what we can to[.]
aid in the restoration of Renais.[.][A]
If you have need of our assistance,[.]
you have but to ask.[A]
I seldom trust people who act from
purely altruistic motives[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[ToggleSmile]But I'll grant you that friendships[.]
are a worthy exception to my distrust.[A][ToggleSmile]
[0C1D]
[OpenFarLeft][LoadFace][0x102][OpenFarRight][LoadFace][0x114][OpenFarLeft]We've finally made it home, haven't we?[.][A][OpenFarRight]Aaah.[.][A]
You must be exhausted after the[.]
journey. Shall we rest, Eirika?[.][A][OpenFarLeft]That would be nice[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
But first we must seal
this away[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][CloseSpeechSlow][OpenFarLeft]This stone banished the Demon King.[.][A]
With such power[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
Do you suppose we could bring[.]
back Father and Lyon[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
That everyone who died in this
dreadful war could be[.][ToggleMouthMove]--[ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenFarRight][MoveMidRight][OpenMidRight]Eirika.[.][A][OpenFarLeft][MoveMidLeft][OpenMidLeft]I know, I know. Such things would be[ToggleMouthMove]--[ToggleMouthMove]
I cannot wish for such things.[A]
No matter how it hurts, or rather because[.]
it hurts, we must learn to accept sorrow.[.][A]
We must take it into our hearts[.]
and tame our grief[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]Eirika[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][CloseSpeechSlow][OpenMidRight]Tell me, Sister[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
If Lyon were here with us, what[.]
do you think he would want?[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]What he would want?[.][A][OpenMidRight]Yes. You see, I think I know.[.]
It was the reason for his studies.[A]
It's why he wanted to know about the
Sacred Stones[.][ToggleMouthMove]--[ToggleMouthMove]or rather the Fire Emblem.[A]
Let's take Lyon's dreams and fulfill
them in his stead.[A]
We can do that, can't we? Without[.]
relying on any mystic power?[A][OpenMidLeft]You're right, Brother, we can.[A]
Let us fulfill his dreams.[A]
As Lyon wanted, as we all want[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][Clear]
So we may live in peace and joy.[A]
[0C1E]
[ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x122][OpenMidLeft]Ephraim[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
It is time I must be going.[.][A]
I am still princess of Rausten, after all.
There is much to which I must attend.[.][A]
Renais and Rausten are far apart, but[.]
that distance can be managed somehow.[.][A]
If you and I were to be betrothed,
that is[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
I wonder if I appear too forward[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
No, how silly of me![A]
[0C1F]
[ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x126][OpenMidLeft]Ephraim[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
I must return to Darkling Woods.[A]
With my father gone, much responsibility
falls on my shoulders.[A]
Yet I would ask[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
May I come and visit you from time
to time?[A]
[0C20]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x10F][OpenMidLeft]We of Frelia will do what we can to[.]
aid in the restoration of Renais.[.][A]
If you have need of our assistance,[.]
you can come to me at any time.[.][A]
And another thing[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
It[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]wasn't such a bad thing, fighting[.]
on the same side as you.[A]
That's all. The day will come, though.
One day, we will see who is the better.[.][A]
[0C21]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x114][OpenFarRight][LoadFace][0x102][OpenFarRight][MoveMidRight][OpenMidRight]Where are you going, Brother?[.][A]
We've endured so much to get
home, and now[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]I'm sorry, Eirika.[A]
I must journey to Grado.[A]
I just received word from Seth.[.][A]
In the south, within the empire,
there has been an enormous landslide.[.][A][OpenMidRight]A landslide?[A][OpenMidLeft]Yes. Word is it was so great that[.]
whole cities were destroyed.[A]
They say the damage is so severe,[.]
the empire itself is in danger[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]That's[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]That's why I must go to Grado.[A]
The people are saying this is Grado's[.]
divine punishment[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
But these are the same citizens Lyon
wanted nothing more than to protect.[A]
I cannot ignore their plight.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Yes, of course not.[.]
I will ride with you.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]No, you must remain in Renais.[A]
Our country is recovering, but we[.]
cannot rest easy.[.][A]
Someone must stay to protect the realm.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Ephraim[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
I understand.[.][A]
I will take your place until you return.[A]
I will wait for you in Renais, Brother.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]I can always depend on you, Eirika.[.][A][CloseSpeechSlow][OpenMidLeft]Lyon[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
I will be king.[.][A]
The type of king we often spoke of[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
Strong and kind in measure: an ideal king.[A]
The people of Renais and Grado are under
my protection, and I won't fail them.[.][A]
Watch and see[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[0C22]
[SetName]Lyon
Oh, are you...[A]
I'm... My name is Lyon.[.][A]
Uh-huh. That's me...
The son of the emperor.[.][A]
You're Prince Ephraim and Princess
Eirika from Renais, aren't you?[.][A]
I heard you were coming, and I've[.]
been waiting here all day.[A]
I've always wanted... I don't have
any friends my own age...[.][A]
So, Prince Ephraim... Princess
Eirika... What do you say?[A][Clear]
From now on, let's be friends...[A]

What are you[ToggleMouthMove]--?[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenRight][ToggleSmile]You looked a little upset[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
I thought I would stroke your[.]
face like I used to[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft][MoveMidLeft][OpenMidLeft]Please stop it. You're treating[.]
me like a child[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenRight][MoveMidRight][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Oh, I'm sorry.
It's just an old habit[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[ToggleSmile]Besides, you were always the one who
pestered me to do it when we were little.[.][A]
Don't you remember?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]N-no, I don't remember![.]
That was such a long time ago[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
Ahh[.][ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]Dear brother, please try to[.]
remember where we are right now.[A]
What would our companions say if they[.]
saw us in such a personal moment?[.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes, that would be embarrassing[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
Forgive me, I did not mean to do
anything you would find unpleasant.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]N-no[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
I didn't mean that[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
It's just[.][ToggleMouthMove]--[ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]So, you really do want
me to stroke your face?[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]No! I mean, look[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Ha ha, you always did blush so easily!
You haven't changed at all![.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]E-enough! Brother[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]you are[.]
starting to anger me![.][A]
[0C54]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x102][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x114][OpenMidLeft][MoveMidLeft][OpenMidLeft]Yaa[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft][MoveLeft][OpenLeft]Yaa![A][......][OpenMidRight]Eirika, try taking a deeper step
forward when you lunge.[.][A]
Otherwise, you might find it hard to
dodge the counterthrust of a foe.[.][A]
That's why you always want to end[.]
a duel with a single blow.[A]
Don't give your opponent the chance[.]
to return the attack.[.][A][OpenLeft][MoveMidLeft][OpenMidLeft]Ah, Brother!
Thank you for the instruction![A]
I suppose I still have a lot to learn.[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]No, not at all![.][A]
Rather, I am surprised at your rapid
progress after such a short time![.][A]
I think you would give me an excellent
match were we to spar.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]You really think so? And yet, I feel[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
Sigh[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]If only we lived in a world where[.]
such skills were not even necessary.[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I see[.][ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]You're a peaceful soul.[.][A]
All of this fighting[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
It must be hard on you.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]It is[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
I just pray that this fighting
will end as swiftly as possible.[A]
No one desires this war.[A]
So why must it continue?[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]Indeed.[.][A]
And yet there is fighting in
every generation.[.][A]
In ancient times, our ancestors[.]
fought all manner of evil beast.[A]
But once the beasts were subdued,[.]
man then fought against fellow man[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
So we learned from Lyon.[A][OpenMidLeft]I know[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
But if men understand the futility
of fighting, why do they do it?[.][A]
We could gain so much more by[.]
cooperation than by conquest.[.][A][OpenMidRight]You may be right[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]But I think[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
I understand why.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Why, Brother[ToggleMouthMove]...?[ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]I pray for peace to return to our[.]
fair Renais.[A]
I know that war brings only sorrow.[.][A]
And yet, somewhere in my heart[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
There is a lust for battle that[.]
cannot be stilled.[A]
It screams within me when[.]
I clutch this spear[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]Brother[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]Perhaps it is because I am a man.[.][A]
Perhaps it is because I was raised
to fight.[.][A][Clear]
I enjoy the practice of my art. I find
pleasure in the battle victorious.[A]
And the stronger I become[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
The more strongly the call to arms
sounds within my ears.[A]
I want to see how great is the skill
that I have acquired.[.][A]
It may be crass and low, but I cannot[.]
deny it.[A][OpenMidLeft]Brother[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]You would disdain me for this?[A][OpenMidLeft]No, I could never[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
But, Brother, listen.[.]
No matter why you fight[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
Please ensure that this fighting brings[.]
good to our people and to our kingdom.[A][OpenMidRight]Of course.
I am not so far gone as that.[.][A]
And I could not bear to see[.]
you cry for our people.[.][A]
[ToggleSmile]Besides, I would fear the judgment
of your mighty sword![.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Brother, I[ToggleMouthMove]--![.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Ha ha! I'm joking, of course![.][A][ToggleSmile]
[0C55]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x102][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x114][OpenMidLeft]Just[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]a bit longer.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Yes, you may be right. There may be[.]
an end to this fighting soon.[.][A]
We may yet defeat the evil in this land[.]
and return it to the hands of men.[A]
Then, Renais may enjoy its former glory.[A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yes[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
You will be crowned king of Renais,[.]
and I will help you rebuild our land.[.][A]
We will make it a happy and prosperous
country, free of conflict.[A]
Just as we three used to dream
about[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]We[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]three.[A]
Lyon was here with us, wasn't he?[.][A]
We three had so many grand ideas
for the futures of our lands.[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yes[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
We talked about a lot.[A]
[ToggleSmile]But Lyon[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]Brother[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
Brother[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]please promise that you[.]
won't ever leave me alone.[A]
Please[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]promise[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]Of course.
I would never leave you.[A]
[ToggleSmile]Why would you ever think I
could do something like that?[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Brother[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]I know better than anyone how you[.]
feel, dear sister.[A]
Ever since we were born[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
No, even before[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
We two have always been together.[.][A]
And together[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
we will always stay.[A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yes, dear brother[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][ToggleSmile]
[0C56]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x102][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x104][OpenMidLeft]Seth.[.][A][OpenMidRight]What brings you, Princess?[A][OpenMidLeft]How fare you, Seth?[.][A]
Ever since the castle fell
you have been protecting me,[A]
despite your own injuries[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]Would that I could have served
you better, my lady[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
You were not meant to see such things.[A]
But my wound has closed up, and it
does not affect my lance arm[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]Wait.[.]
Show it to me.[A]
Look. The wound has closed, but[.]
it has not yet fully healed.[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
What made you think of this, my lady?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Your fighting is as superb as ever, Seth.[.][A]
But when you raise your lance, I see a
flicker of pain on your face,[.][A]
as if you were merely enduring it[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
But it only lasts a moment. Perhaps[.]
it is all just my imagination[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]Your Highness, please put your
mind at ease.[.][A]
My wound has healed. There
is no reason to worry.[A][OpenMidLeft]I would that were so, Seth.[.][A]
Please do not overextend yourself.
I beg this of you.[A]
Without you, I may not be able
to continue this quest[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]You praise me too much, my lady[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[0C57]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x102][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x104][OpenMidLeft][MoveMidLeft][OpenMidLeft]Hrrngh[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft][MoveLeft][OpenLeft]Hahh![.][A][CloseSpeechSlow][......][OpenLeft][MoveMidLeft][OpenMidLeft]What do you think?[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]Your sword arm is magnificent, my lady.[.][A]
You have improved yet again.[A][OpenMidLeft]Thank you.[A]
It is only because I know my brother will[.]
scold me if I do not practice every day.[A]
But I still am nowhere near your
level of skill, Seth.[.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]My lady, I hardly think[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]Perhaps next time, you could spar with
me and help me learn some technique?[A]
The basics I've learned from my brother[.]
all apply to skills with the spear.[.][A]
If I could learn the sword techniques[.]
of the Knights of Renais,[.][A]
then perhaps I could be even stronger.[A]
I would be of greater help to you[.]
on the battlefield.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]Yes, but[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
Princess Eirika, I think you should[.]
stay away from the front lines.[.][A]
You are of the royal family of Renais.
Please leave the fighting to me[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]Still[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
How can I just watch from afar while
others risk their lives for me?[.][A]
I cannot rely on you always.[A]
I must learn to protect myself.[.][A]
So please, continue to observe
as I practice.[A][OpenMidRight]Princess Eirika[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[0C58]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x102][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x104][OpenMidLeft]Seth, do you have a moment?[.][A]
Could you help me practice
a bit right now?[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]Princess Eirika.[A]
Before I do, there is something[.]
I must say to you.[A][OpenMidLeft]Yes, what is it?[A][OpenMidRight]Please forgive my rudeness[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
Princess, I am merely your subject.[.][A]
Recently, you have been too close to me.[A]
It is not becoming of a noble of Renais to
fraternize in this way with her subjects.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Oh[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]But I[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
it's just that your wound[.]
has not yet[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
I was merely[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]It's true. The wound I received the day[.]
our castle fell has not yet healed[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
Perhaps it will afflict me to the end[.]
of my life.[.][A]
But it would be a mistake to assume[.]
you owe me a debt for this wound.[.][A]
This thought should not rest beneath
the crown you soon must wear.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]But still, you suffered for me[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]Lady Eirika.[A]
You are a noble of Renais.[A]
The nobility should not favor[.]
one subject over another.[.][A]
How can they maintain their fealty
if you treat one so differently?[A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]You may have to forego such attachments[.]
just to defend your country.[A]
There will be times when victory
in battle demands a sacrifice.[A]
If you cannot send your men to die,[.]
then you are not fit to rule.[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
I understand[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
Seth[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
You are correct.[A]
I had forgotten my place,[.]
and I had forgotten my duty.[A]
Please forgive me.[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]That night[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
We fled from the soldiers of Grado[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
You held me tight, keeping me safe
from the enemy's blades[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
Perhaps[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]I did feel something
more for you then.[A]
But[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]it was improper for a[.]
queen of Renais.[A]
And with my father dead, I suppose
that is my station.[.][A]
I am a queen, and you are a knight
in my service.[A]
If I do not keep this in mind, then I will
never be able to rebuild our kingdom.[.][A][OpenMidRight]I thank you for your understanding,[.]
my lady.[A]
Now, if you will excuse me[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A][CloseSpeechSlow][.......][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x104][.....][OpenMidRight]Princess Eirika.[A]
If you would allow me to say
one more thing[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]Seth[ToggleMouthMove]...?[ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]That night[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
I felt what you felt.[.][A]
When I held you in my arms as[.]
we rode into the night[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
It was the first time since I was[.]
knighted that I forgot my duty.[.][A]
I thought of you not as my queen,[.][A]
but rather as someone I wanted
to protect from all harm.[.][A]
I wanted to leave everything behind[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
To take you far away to someplace[.]
where we could be together[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
Those were my thoughts[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]Seth[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]Please forgive me.[A]
I swear to you that I will never
again forget my duty in that way.[.][A]
Now, please excuse me.[A]
When I see you next, it will be[.]
as a Knight of Renais[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
And I will lay down my life[.]
to protect my queen.[A][OpenMidRight][ClearFace][.......][OpenMidLeft]Seth[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[0C59]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x102][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x122][OpenMidRight]Good day to you, Princess.[A]
What a funny thing that we should meet
here! It is providence, I tell you![.][A][OpenMidLeft]L'Arachel, it is NOT providence.
It is not even a coincidence.[.][A]
We agreed to meet here when we
planned out our battle strategy.[A]
Wait[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]Don't tell me that you
don't remember that![A][OpenMidRight]We planned this?[A]
I suppose I simply don't usually
worry about such trifling details.[A]
And here we are, so I suppose that
our plan must be working.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]I suppose you're right.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Still, divine providence or not,
isn't it strange and wonderful?[.][A]
A beautiful princess traveling with[.]
such a ragged bunch as this[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
You could have told me much sooner,[.]
you know![.][A][OpenMidLeft]My apologies.[.][A]
Necessity demanded that I conceal[.]
my identity at the time.[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Oh, it is no longer any worry.[A]
To be honest, I believe I had figured out[.]
your ruse from the very moment we met.[A]
I said to myself, [OpenQuote]This lovely woman
could only be of my own superior breeding.[CloseQuote][.][A]
After all, you could never truly fool[.]
a woman with my keen mind.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]My. How[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]impressive.[.][A][OpenMidRight]There is something about nobility that
simply cannot be hidden from its kin![.][A]
[ToggleSmile]Why, Eirika, certainly you must have
felt the same thing upon seeing me?[.][A]
You surely saw a refinement and grace of
carriage surpassing that of common folk?[A][ToggleSmile][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Err[.][ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]Aheh[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
Yes, why[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]the very first time[.]
I met you, I could see that you[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
You were very far from common.[A][OpenMidRight]Exactly. Far from common. I could[.]
not have put it better myself.[A]
It's simply impossible to travel
incognito these days.[.][A]
[0C5A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x122][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102][OpenMidLeft][MoveMidLeft][OpenMidLeft]Take that![A]
[OpenMidLeft][MoveMidLeft][OpenMidLeft][MoveMidLeft][OpenMidLeft]And that and that and that![.][A][OpenMidRight]L'Arachel?[.....]
What are you doing?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]I'm practicing! I want to be prepared[.]
for when those fiends next show up.[.][A]
You never can tell where or when
they'll appear, after all.[A]
And if they were to appear and I were[.]
unable to prepare a magical attack[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
Well, I'd like to be ready to whack[.]
them with this staff of mine.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Ahhh[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]Don't you think that's a
bit, well, dangerous?[.][A]
Perhaps you should stop.[A]
If monsters appear when I am around,
I promise I'll come to your aid.[A][OpenMidLeft]That's simply no good, Eirika. You
know how those monsters can be.[.][A]
I insist that I be able to hold my
own, relying on nothing but my skills.[A][OpenMidRight]I've been curious about[.]
something, L'Arachel[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
Why are you so obsessed[.]
with fighting monsters?[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]My parents were kind people. I would
be like them if I am able.[A]
My home of Rausten is so near to Darkling[.]
Woods. We experienced many sudden raids.[A]
[ToggleSmile]My parents took it upon themselves to[.]
defend our people against the monsters.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]I had no idea[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]Yes, but my parents are gone now.[.][A]
I've been told that they passed away
when I was but an infant.[.][A]
They[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]gave their lives defending
many helpless people.[.][A][OpenMidRight]I'm so sorry.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Oh, you needn't be sad. I would[.]
not want for that.[A]
No, it's wonderful that they gave[.]
their lives battling that filth.[A]
I was so young that I do not remember[.]
their faces, if I must be honest.[.][A]
[ToggleSmile]However, that does not diminish the[.]
pride I feel for what they've done.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]Don't you feel lonely at
the loss of your parents?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]No! Not at all![.][A]
What do you take me for?
Some kind of weakling?[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]No, I see that you are
strong indeed, L'Arachel.[.][A][ToggleSmile][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]I should say so.[A]
But[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]would you not say that
you are strong, too, Eirika?[A]
Your father stayed in his castle,[.]
fighting the forces of Grado.[.][A]
He had a noble death, don't[.]
you think?[A]
Your father was a great man.[A]
You must be quite proud of him.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Well[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]yes.[A]
He refused to take even one step in retreat[.]
from the advancing Grado soldiers.[A]
[ToggleSmile]But still[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
I mean, I[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]I would have thought no[.]
less of him if he had fled.[.][A]
Even if he were no longer a brave king[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
Still[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
I would be happier if he were still alive.[A][ToggleSmile][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Eirika[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][Clear]
I do understand you.[A]
Everyone would tell me of my parents'[.]
bravery, of their honor[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
But I will never see them. I will[.]
never know them for myself.[.][A]
Oh, what I would give if I could have[.]
met them[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]just once.[A][OpenMidRight]L'Arachel[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[0C5B]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x122][OpenMidRight]Eirika[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]Please hold[.]
for a moment.[.][A][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x102][OpenMidLeft]What is it, L'Arachel?[A][OpenMidRight]About what we were discussing earlier[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
I would not want you to get the wrong[.]
idea.[.][A]
I was not saying I was lonely because[.]
my parents were dead.[.][A]
I am not that weak, you know?[.][A]
I have never even[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]cried[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]when
thinking of my parents.[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I know, L'Arachel.
You are a very strong person.[.][A]
We are lucky to have you with us.[.][A][ToggleSmile][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]I hope you do not think this
all too sudden, but[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
Here. Look at this.[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]What's this[.][ToggleMouthMove]...?[ToggleMouthMove][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]This ruby has been in Rausten for[.]
generations. It is a valuable gem.[A]
I would be honored if[.][ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]I would[.]
like for you to have it.[A][OpenMidLeft]What? No, I couldn't! It's
far too precious to accept[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]No, I mean it. Please, accept[.]
this as a gift.[.][A]
Here.[.][A]
I won't allow you to refuse.[A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]L'Arachel[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[ToggleSmile]Thank you. I will treasure it.[A]
I so wish I had something to give[.]
you in return[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]You needn't feel that way.
Here, I've an idea[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
Once we've put an end to all the
monstrosities in our lands[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
Invite me to Renais. Does this
plan please you?[A][OpenMidLeft]Yes[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]certainly. Of course.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Then we are agreed![.][A]
Now, you had better not[.]
go dying in battle on me.[.][A]
Not until then, at any rate.
Do I have your word?[A][OpenMidLeft]Yes[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]let us both live long[.]
enough to look back on this time.[.][A]
I am sure that, when we do look back,[.]
it will be as the best of friends.[A]
[0C5C]
[ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x102][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x12C][OpenMidRight]Ah, Eirika.[.][A]
Shall we ride together a while?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Tana, you seem well.[A]
And yes, I'd appreciate[.]
the company.[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I feel I should apologize.[A]
I'm afraid I haven't been very
much help to you, Eirika.[.][A]
To be honest, I'm still in training,
and not quite battle-ready.[.][A]
Perhaps you'd fare better if I were[.]
not traveling with you[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Tana, that's not true at all.[.]
You've been a great help to us.[.][A]
I have seen you in action. I know[.]
what I'm talking about.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Thank you, Eirika.[A]
Heh[.][ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]I feel so foolish now.[A][OpenMidLeft]Why is that?[A][OpenMidRight]I look on you as a sister, Eirika.[A]
And yet, even though we're the same[.]
age, you seem so much more mature.[A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Hardly[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]It is you who even gave me the
courage to leave the castle.[A]
I wanted to be out on my own, like
you, to pattern my life after yours.[A]
I'm simply glad that we are friends.[A][OpenMidLeft]Me too, Tana.[.][A]
I'm glad you came. You help[.]
to remind me of better times.[.][A]
[0C5D]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x12C][OpenMidLeft]Oh, Brother[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
I'm going to get you
for this, Brother[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102][OpenMidRight]What's wrong, Tana?[.][A]
Has something happened
to Innes?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]My brother is so cruel![.]
Listen to what he said to me![.][A]
He told me that I was just in[.]
everyone's way[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
He said I should just go back[.]
home to Frelia[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]Oh, dear[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]I'm so depressed.[.][A]
He's always like that, too.[.][A]
He just makes fun of me and[.]
insults me and teases me.[.][A]
I hate him so much![.][A][OpenMidRight]Tana, your brother has a strange
way of showing his concern[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
But he IS concerned about you.
You can see that, can't you?[A][OpenMidLeft]Yes, but[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]Even my brother gets angry at me when I[.]
put myself at risk, even for a good cause.[A]
Your brother is harsh and rough of speech,
but he doesn't want you to get hurt.[A][OpenMidLeft]Well[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]I suppose[.]
you're right.[.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Why don't we go speak with him later?[.][A]
I'll be right beside you.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Ah[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]all right.[A]
[ToggleSmile]But, Eirika[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
I still envy you.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]Me?[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]You and Ephraim as so close[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
You understand one another.[.]
It must be[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]so nice[.][ToggleSmile][A]
I wish my brother and I shared
that kind of connection.[A][OpenMidRight]Well, we are twins, you know.[.][A]
I think that makes us slightly
different from normal siblings.[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]But you two never fight or
anything, do you?[.][A]
How do you two maintain such
a close relationship?[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]I[.][ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]Well[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
Isn't that normal for twins?[A]
[0C5E]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x102][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x12C][OpenMidRight]Eirika, are you all right?[A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I am, thank you, Tana.[A]
I always feel better when[.]
you're around.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]I've been wondering[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
Eirika, do you think I've[.]
grown stronger?[.][A]
I mean, stronger than when I was
cooped up in the castle at least?[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yes, of course you have.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]Really?[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Tana, you should have more
confidence in your abilities.[.][A]
If I had to rely on my own blade
alone, I would not survive.[.][A]
But with you around, I know I[.]
can keep fighting.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]You think? I guess I'm
still not sure.[.][A]
[ToggleSmile]Still, it is nice to
hear you say that.[A]
Eirika, we'll get through[.]
this, the two of us.[A]
And when we do, let's sit[.]
together and just relax.[A][ToggleSmile][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Sure, Tana.[.][A]
But first, we'll have to
apologize to King Hayden.[.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Oh[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
Father[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]I wonder
if he's still mad.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Yes, you probably should.[.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Say, Eirika.
Could you[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Of course[.][ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]I understand.[.][A]
You and I will speak to him[.]
together. Don't you worry.[A]
[0C5F]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x102][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x10F][OpenMidRight]Eirika. I know this might[.]
seem sudden, but[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
I've decided I must[.]
protect you for a while.[A][OpenMidLeft]What?[.][A]
What do you mean by that?[.][A][OpenMidRight]I was in a difficult situation
at Carcino.[.][A]
I[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]must admit that I owe you[.]
much for your help that day.[A][OpenMidLeft]I[.][ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]I see.[A][OpenMidRight]So now, I've decided to protect[.]
you in battle.[A]
I don't know how to say this,[.]
but[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
It is unacceptable that I[.]
remain indebted to you.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Oh, you and your fool pride[.][ToggleMouthMove]--[ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]Regardless, you can count on me.[A]
No arrow can reach all enemies,[.]
but I guarantee your safety.[A]
Will you accept my oath?[A][OpenMidLeft]Er[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]Sure.[.][A]
I accept.[.][A]
Thank you,
Prince Innes.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Follow me, then.[A][OpenMidLeft]Uh, wait a moment, Innes.[.][A]
You're an archer[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]Wouldn't it make
more sense if you stayed behind me?[.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[0C60]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x102][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x10F][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]What are you doing?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]What is it now, Innes?[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]I told you I was going
to protect you.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Right.[A][OpenMidRight]And yet, whenever an enemy shows
himself, you rush in and attack![A]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]Everyone's going to think you're
the one protecting me.[A][OpenMidLeft]Well, I can't help you with your
image problems, Innes.[A]
You're an archer, while I have
to fight up close.[A][OpenMidRight]That is unacceptable.[.][A]
I said that I would protect you,
and I was being quite sincere.[A][OpenMidLeft]And I appreciate that.[A]
It's nice to know that, when
I cross swords with the enemy,[A]
you're never far from me, with
your bow close at hand.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Eirika[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]You are so kind[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
You're so different from that[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
brother of yours.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]No, not as much as you think.[.][A]
Maybe you only see him as a[.]
warrior, as competition,[A]
[ToggleSmile]but he is a fine and gentle[.]
man, capable of great compassion.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]If you say so.[A]
I suppose I cannot doubt it[.]
if it comes from your lips.[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Prince Innes, please, try to
befriend my brother.[A]
I know he would want this as well.[A]
I don't know why you dislike him.  When[.]
I am alone with him, he is so kind.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]Forgive me, but I can bear no more
of this talk.[.][A]
When I see you look that way, I feel
only jealousy for this Ephraim.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]What[ToggleMouthMove]--?[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]He is[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]a hard man to forgive.[A]
Perhaps there is only one[.]
way to settle this.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Prince Innes[ToggleMouthMove]...?[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[0C61]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x102][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x10F][OpenMidRight]Eirika.[.][A]
Forgive the intrusion, but I
must speak to you at once.[A][OpenMidLeft]Prince Innes?[.]
What is it?[.][A][OpenMidRight]First, just listen to me.[.][A]
Is there[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]anyone who lays[.]
claim to your heart?[A][OpenMidLeft]What?[.][A]
N-no[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]There's[.]
nobody like that.[.][A][OpenMidRight]I see. Then let me speak frankly.[.][A]
Eirika, it seems I have fallen in[.]
love with you.[A][OpenMidLeft]Wh-what!?[.][A]
This is no place for jokes, Innes!
Why would you say something like that?[A][OpenMidRight]This is no joke.
I am absolutely serious.[A]
These feelings surprise me as[.]
well. I don't know what to do.[A]
Fighting at your side all this time,
the emotion just exploded within me.[A]
I love you. I could not bear to[.]
see you in the arms of another.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]P-Prince Innes![.][A]
I[.][ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]I[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]No, Eirika.[.]
Do not answer now.[A]
I have not yet bested Ephraim. I have[.]
not earned the right to woo you.[A][OpenMidLeft]Wha[.][ToggleMouthMove]--? [ToggleMouthMove]Why are you bringing my[.]
brother into this?[A][OpenMidRight]With a man like him around, I can see[.]
why you show no interest in suitors.[A]
If I prove myself his superior, you[.]
will surely accept my hand.[.][A]
If I fail, I release any claim to[.]
your affection.[.][A]
[ToggleSmile]But I swear it on the depth of my[.]
love that I will destroy that man.[A]
Eirika, I will expect your answer then.[.][A]
That's all I have to say.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight][ClearFace][.......][OpenMidLeft]Innes![A]
What an[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]infuriating man![A]
Why does he have to be so[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[0C62]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x117][OpenMidRight]Aaaah[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x102][OpenMidLeft]Forde, you're looking[.]
in rare form today.[.][A][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x116][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]Ah, Princess! Yes, I'm trying[.]
not to overextend myself today.[.][A]
I see you're looking well, too.[.][A]
[ToggleSmile]Except for[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yes, Forde?[.][.....]
What is it?[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]Well[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]I was just thinking[.]
about something[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
Princess, do you find that your armor[.]
leaves a bit too much[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]exposed?[A][OpenMidLeft]I beg your pardon?[A][OpenMidRight]You know, too exposed. Especially around
the[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]er[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]midriff, if you will.[.][A]
Aren't you worried that, in the heat
of battle, it might, eh[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]Fly up like this?[.][A][OpenMidRight][MoveMidRight][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Augh![.][.....]
Oh[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]Uh[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
You were[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]just joking. Wow.[.]
Don't scare me like that![.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Oh, I'm sorry. That must have[.]
seemed rather unladylike.[.][A]
Honestly, though, I do rather[.]
like this armor.[A]
It's very easy to move around in.[.][A]
I think that freedom of movement is[.]
far more important to me in combat.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Well, sure. I guess everyone has
his own preference.[.][A]
I've gotten many long years of use
from my armor.[A][OpenMidLeft]I can imagine.[A]
[ToggleSmile]Now that I look at it, I can see
all the scars from all your fights.[.][A][ToggleSmile][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]A knight's greatest pride are the scars[.]
his armor bears for him.[A]
This battered shell of mine is the only[.]
true badge of valor[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]The only real sign that I've weathered
blade and arrow for king and country.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Forde[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Oh, and[.][ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]Well, in my case[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
Some of these dents are from me falling[.]
off my horse. Heh[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
Oh, and some come from falling asleep in
my armor and rolling onto my weapons.[.][A]
Kind of a lot of them, actually.
Heh[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][ToggleSmile][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]You stood by my brother when he[.]
and I were separated, didn't you?[.][A]
I never got a chance to thank you.[A][OpenMidRight]Oh, it was nothing. Really.[.][A]
To be fair, Ephraim probably saved
my hide more often than I his.[A][OpenMidLeft]I doubt that. My brother rushes into
battle without thought for consequence.[.][A]
I think, if nothing else, you restrained
his natural recklessness.[.][A]
I owe you a debt. Both you and Kyle.[A][OpenMidRight]Princess Eirika[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]Forde, Renais thanks you. May[.]
you always stand beside us.[.][A][OpenMidRight]At your service, Princess.[A]
[0C63]
[ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x102][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x116][OpenMidRight]Princess Eirika! Good to see you.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Ah, Forde. Yes, it's good to have[.]
you fighting at my side again.[A]
It's only because of your skill[.]
that I'm fighting here today.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Well, we all seem to be deep
in this fight, milady[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]Yes, there's no pulling back now.[.][A][OpenMidRight]So it would seem. My lady, leave
the fighting to us soldiers.[A]
Even if there be an unholy hail of arrows,
we would ride into them for your sake.[A][OpenMidLeft]Ha ha[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][.....] Why, thank you, sir knight![A][CloseSpeechSlow][......][OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]Say, Forde.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Yes?[A][OpenMidLeft]What will you do when all[.]
this fighting is over?[A][OpenMidRight]When the fighting is over?[.....]
Hm[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]Good question.[A]
Well[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
I suppose I'll return to Renais[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
and take a very, very long nap.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]That does sound like you.[.]
And then?[.][A][OpenMidRight]Then? I would like to return
to my painting, I think.[A][OpenMidLeft]You paint?[A][OpenMidRight]Yes, milady. I paint.[.][A]
In the past, I've tried to be quiet[.]
about this little hobby of mine.[A]
However, quite a few of our group[.]
have unearthed my hidden secret.[A][OpenMidLeft]Is that so? Well, I'd love to[.]
view your work sometime.[A][OpenMidRight]Ah, I'd be honored.[.][A]
It's hardly worthy of such an audience,[.]
but I'd be glad to show it to you.[A][OpenMidLeft]I look forward to it.[.][A]
Oh![.][.....]
And[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]Yes?[A][OpenMidLeft]Would you ever consider[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
doing a portrait of me?[.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I'm sorry?[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Is that distasteful to you?[.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]No! No[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
It's just that I so[.]
rarely do portraits.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]So, it would be a bother?[.][A][OpenMidRight]Not at all! A bother? Really.[.][A]
This request comes from my princess.
I'd be more than happy to.[A][OpenMidLeft]Thank you, Forde.[.][A]
[0C64]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x102][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x116][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]Princess Eirika.[A][OpenMidLeft]Forde.[A][OpenMidRight]You asked me earlier what I would[.]
do when all this fighting ended[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]I remember[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]Well, I should have asked you, too.[.][A]
What will you do when this fighting ends?[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Me?[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]Yes.[A][OpenMidLeft]I[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
I'd like to restore Renais and bring
happiness back to her people.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]Princess Eirika[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]It is not enough that this war
end[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]that we go home again.[A]
It's not enough that my brother[.]
become king.[A]
These things aren't enough to[.]
make a good country.[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][.....][OpenMidLeft]People deserve happiness. They are
the reason that we rule.[A]
Without the people, there can be
no Renais.[A][OpenMidRight]To live happily, to be proud
of our nation[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
To restore the happiness
of her people[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yes, that is my dream now.[A]
It is an abstract goal, and 
perhaps a little vague, but[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]No, not at all![.][A][OpenMidLeft]How so?[.][A][OpenMidRight]I mean, rebuilding a country, now[.]
THAT is an abstract goal.[.][A]
But what you've described, that[.]
is a wonderful ambition.[A]
I've never been so proud to[.]
serve the kingdom of Renais.[A][OpenMidLeft]Forde[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]I've come to a decision!
[ToggleSmile]I know I've already sworn an oath, but[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
I want to renew that vow. Please, let[.]
me help make your dream come true![A]
I'll do anything I can to help you[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]as
long as it doesn't require heavy lifting.[.][A][ToggleSmile][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Thank you[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
I'm very grateful to you, Forde.[A]
It feels like this war might never end,[.]
and our people give in to despair quickly.[A]
But thanks to people like you, who smile
in the face of sorrow, they can be saved.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Oh, no. You make too much of it.
I'm nothing special.[A]
I simply cannot allow myself to worry[.]
when there's fighting to be done.[.][A]
You're the special one. You have such[.]
a profound effect on us all.[A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]Me? How so?[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]It is because of you that we can go on.[.][A]
You and the prince are here, risking
your lives for the cause.[.][A]
Your guidance, your leadership[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]It
gives us a reason to live as well.[A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]A reason[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]to live?[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]Yes[.][ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]To restore that radiant[.]
smile to your own lovely face.[A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Oh![.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]I fight to see you smile again, to
drive the worry from your face.[.][A]
If I can do that, then I will be more[.]
than happy to paint your portrait.[A][OpenMidLeft]Forde[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]We'll do it together. Every day is
another step closer to the end of war.[A]
One step closer to making your dream
come true.[A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]Agreed![.][A]
[0C65]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x102][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x120][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Master Saleh![.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]Master?[.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][CloseSpeechSlow][.......][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]Oh, I'm sorry, Princess Eirika.[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]It's all right.[.]
Were you[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]praying?[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]Not exactly. It's[.]
called Valega.[A][OpenMidLeft]Valega?[.][A][OpenMidRight]Yes.[A][OpenMidLeft]What is it?[.][A]
Is it something to do with
Caer Pelyn's cultural history?[A][OpenMidRight]Yes, in a sense. Think of it as[.]
a kind of wish. A very pure wish.[.][A]
It is a wish that expands far[.]
beyond individual desire.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]I see. I don't claim to understand, but[.]
[ToggleSmile]it sounds very interesting.[.][A]
If you don't mind, I'd like to
hear more about it later.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]If you like.[A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yes, I would.[.][A][ToggleSmile]
[0C66]
[ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x102][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x120][OpenMidLeft]Master Saleh.[.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Princess.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]What you were telling me about
Valega was most enlightening.[.][A]
It sounds as though you align your
desires with the world around you.[A]
By knowing the vastness of creation[.]
around you, you come to know yourself.[A]
And then, by transcending your selfish
needs, you wish for a better world.[.][A]
What you told me, it helped me rediscover[.]
the importance of that unselfish wish.[A]
It's the reason for the war we fight
now[.][ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]The dream of a better world.[A]
Because of your Valega, my own
conviction was renewed.[.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Ahhh. I'm glad to hear that.
[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
Princess Eirika, you remind me of[.]
the warrior princess, Nada Kuya.[A][ToggleSmile][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Nada Kuya?[A][OpenMidRight]She's one of Caer Pelyn's[.]
ancient heroes.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]I'd like to hear about her.[.][A][OpenMidRight]I've been told she was a strong[.]
woman, beautiful and proud.[.][A]
She spoke with the voice of nature,[.]
and she lived at one with the earth.[A][OpenMidLeft]But you called her a battle princess[ToggleMouthMove]...?[ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]Well, in ancient times, Caer Pelyn
was invaded by a foreign nation.[A][OpenMidLeft]Really?[.][A][OpenMidRight]And leading the charge against the
invaders was Nada Kuya.[.][A]
She carried a narrow sword made from a
fang gifted to her by the dragonkin.[A]
With her dragon blade in her hand,
she drove Caer Pelyn's enemies away.[A][OpenMidLeft]Wow[.][ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]Quite a story.[.....]
And you think I[.][ToggleMouthMove]--[ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]Yes. You remind me of her.[A][OpenMidLeft]No, no[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
When Grado invaded Renais, I was
paralyzed. I couldn't do anything.[A]
It is only because of the sacrifices
of others that I could even escape.[.][A][OpenMidRight]But now, you are here. With[.]
your strength, courage, and dignity.[A][OpenMidLeft]Master Saleh[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]If you achieve victory, the[.]
legend will become reality.[.][A]
You will become the Nada Kuya[.]
of this age.[A][OpenMidLeft]I see[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][ToggleSmile] Yes, I see![A]
I have a reason to fight.[.]
I have things to protect.[.][A]
I fight for the future. The future
of Renais, the future of my people.[.][A]
Thank you, Master Saleh.[A]
Your stories always give me the[.]
courage to fight on.[A][ToggleSmile][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]I'm glad to hear that.[A][OpenMidLeft]I pray your wisdom guides[.]
us through this war.[A][OpenMidRight]I will do what I can.[.][A]
[0C67]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x102][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x120][OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][.....]
What troubles you, Princess Eirika?[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Oh, Master Saleh.[.][A]
No, nothing. My mind was
somewhere else[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
Oh, and in the middle of
a battle[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]I'm sorry.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]Don't be sorry.[.][A]
I am not going to judge you[.]
for how you think or act.[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Thank you.[A]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][.....]
I was just remembering my home.[.][A]
I was thinking about the last[.]
time Renais was at peace.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]There were the most beautiful[.]
mountains, the clearest rivers[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
The scent of wildflowers filled the[.]
air. The sky was clear and bright.[A]
This was before war scarred the[.]
hills and scorched the skies.[.][A]
It was a wonderful place. Every day[.]
was filled with hope and possibility.[.][A]
My brother and I would go hunting[.]
with Prince Lyon.[.][A]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]I would make lunches for us. Ephraim
would tease, but Lyon was happy.[A][Clear]
I[.][ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]I miss that time so very much.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]Princess Eirika[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][Clear]
I give you my word that you will once[.]
again see the Renais you love restored.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Master Saleh[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
[ToggleSmile]I do hope so.[.][A]
But first, you and I must concentrate[.]
on the battle at hand. We must win.[.][A]
Thank you, Master Saleh.[A][Clear]
Your homeland, Caer Pelyn, was also[.]
a most beautiful place.[.][A][ToggleSmile][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]We had nothing special. But, because of[.]
that, we had[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]everything.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]I didn't understand that before.[A]
Now, I think I know what you mean.[A][OpenMidRight]I am glad.[A][OpenMidLeft]When we have to fight no more, please,
let me visit you in Caer Pelyn.[.][A]
I would like to know more about your
home. About Valega and Nada Kuya.[.][A][OpenMidRight]You are welcome anytime. Caer Pelyn[.]
and I will welcome you with open arms.[A]
[0C68]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x114][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x118][OpenMidRight]Prince Ephraim![.][A][OpenMidLeft]Kyle, what's the matter?[A][OpenMidRight]Prince Ephraim[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
You charged at the enemy line[.]
after you were injured, didn't you?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Oh, that? That was nothing.[.]
Don't worry about it.[.][A][OpenMidRight]It's not the injury I'm worried about. You're[.]
not supposed to do things like that![A][OpenMidLeft]If I retreat at the first scratch,
command will fall apart.[A][OpenMidRight]My lord, you are the future of
Renais, the commander of this army.[.][A]
If something were to happen to you,[.]
morale would be shattered.[A]
We would lose this war. All because[.]
of your misplaced pride.[A][OpenMidLeft]Fine, Kyle. I'll hang back and
let you knights lead the charge.[A]
But I don't have time to talk[.]
about this now. I'm leaving.[A][OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][......][OpenMidRight]He says he's going to stop being
so reckless, but I know better.[.][A]
I have to stop him before[.]
he gets himself killed[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[0C69]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x114][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x118][OpenMidRight]Do you remember what we agreed to[.]
last time we talked, Prince Ephraim?[A][OpenMidLeft]Sigh. High command must remain behind[.]
the vanguard and let the soldiers fight.[A]
And if he tries to take the van, any
unit, regardless of rank, may stop him.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Yes, exactly. So you
do remember it.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]And now, every time I try to lead[.]
the charge, my own men stop me![.][A]
They waste themselves worrying about
my safety when their own is at risk.[A]
Look, I agreed to your plan at the
time, but this is just ridiculous.[A]
I'm going to revoke the order.[A][OpenMidRight]No, Prince! I know I've told you
this before[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
But you have to remember, you're
the future of Renais[ToggleMouthMove]--[ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]And if we fail because I do not[.]
join the battle, we have no future![.][A]
I do know I bear much responsibility,[.]
but I simply must revoke the command.[.][A][OpenMidRight]I'm sorry, Prince Ephraim, but I
can't allow you to do that.[.][A]
I'm going back to the fight. Make[.]
sure you hang back, sire. Go on.[A][OpenMidRight][ClearFace][......][OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]Sigh[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]That blasted Kyle.[A][Clear]
I know that he's simply concerned[.]
about me.[.][A]
[ToggleSmile]Come to think of it, he's always
been like that.[.][A]
I can't recall a moment when he HASN'T
been overly worried about me.[.][A]
[ToggleSmile]But that order really needs to go.[A]
[0C6A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x114][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x118][OpenMidRight]My lord prince[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
I must apologize.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Why is that, Kyle? What do
you need to apologize for?[A][OpenMidRight]The other day, I was injured on[.]
the battlefield.[A]
You raced to my side without a
moment's hesitation.[A]
As I lost consciousness, I heard
you say something I won't forget.[.][A]
[OpenQuote]Treat this man as you would my own[.]
brother. Help him, regardless of cost.[CloseQuote][.][A][OpenMidLeft]And why must you apologize for that?[A][OpenMidRight]I ought to have been the one riding[.]
to your aid, my lord.[.][A]
And that you would consider a lowborn[.]
knight like myself a brother[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
All these years, I've thought of myself[.]
as nothing but a loyal retainer.[A]
I failed to understand that our[.]
bond runs deeper.[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]Since I was a child, you've[.]
taught me how to be a warrior.[A]
A prince is raised to be detached.
Distant. To rule the people from above.[.][A]
I could not afford to feel any real[.]
affection for anyone. Just Seth, Forde[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
And you, Kyle.
You were the only ones.[.][A]
I realize that much separates us,[.]
but I still consider you family.[A]
Although[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]you do worry about me too much.[.]
And you have to stop snapping at me.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]Prince Ephraim, when I was injured the
other day, I came to a realization.[.][A]
I was wrong. The decision I made you
agree to the other day was wrong.[.][A]
You belong on the front lines, like[.]
any of the noble warriors of Renais.[A]
It will do the men's morale good to[.]
see you fighting at their side.[.][A]
[ToggleSmile]From now on, fight as you must![.][A]
I will be beside you, and I will
protect you as you fight at our side.[.][A][ToggleSmile][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Thank you, Kyle. I was so caught in[.]
my worry that I couldn't fight well.[A]
And I will make a concession to[.]
you as well.[A]
I will not be so reckless anymore.
I know I have an important position.[A]
Are we in agreement, Kyle?[A][OpenMidRight]We are, my lord.
Let's ride on together![.][A][OpenMidLeft]Sounds good. Kyle[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
Don't fall behind![A][OpenMidRight]Yes, sire![A]
[0C6B]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x116][.......][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x114][OpenMidRight][MoveMidRight][......][OpenMidLeft]Hey, Forde[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]Yes?[.....]
[ToggleSmile]Oh! What is it, Prince Ephraim?[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]What are you hiding?[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]What are you talking about? We are
in the middle of a battle, you know.[A]
Pay less attention to me and more[.]
to our enemies![.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]No, no, Forde. Give it up.
Come on[.][ToggleMouthMove]--[ToggleMouthMove]let me see it.[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]Fine.[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]What is that?[.]
Is that a painting?[.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]This? No, no[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]No, it's
a topographic map! Yes.[.][A]
For strategy. We need to plot[.]
out our strategy, don't we?[.][A]
During battles, I like to look at[.]
this map and analyze enemy lines[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]But[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]that's clearly a
landscape painting.[.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]Did you paint this?[.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Er[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]Yes. A long time ago.[.][A][ToggleSmile][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]This is impressive, Forde. You're good
with both a sword and a brush![A]
You know, when Eirika and I were young,[.]
we'd sneak out for long horse rides.[A]
We used to watch the sunset sink behind[.]
the mountains while we talked for hours.[A]
Your painting reminds me of those days.[.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][.....]
Prince Ephraim[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]But[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]during a battle probably isn't
the right place to indulge your hobby.[A]
What if something happened to you?[A][ToggleSmile][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I'm no fool, Prince Ephraim. I always[.]
stay alert on the battlefield.[A]
I'll cut down any enemy that crosses
my path. Well, Prince[.][ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]Good luck![A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight][ClearFace][.......][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Heh[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
You're all talk.[A][ToggleSmile]
[0C6C]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x114][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x116][OpenMidLeft]So, Forde[.][ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]Not goofing[.]
around today, are you?[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]Of course not! I never fool around
in a battle.[A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]Yes, but only in battle.[A]
Next to Franz, you seem like
you're always half asleep.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]You surely understand how difficult it
is to be compared with one's siblings.[A]
Next to you, the princess seems so
kind and thoughtful. And caring, too![.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I see your point. Yes, it's rough[.]
being held to your sibling's standards.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]Isn't it, though? So let's stop all[.]
this and get back to the fighting.[A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]Although[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Hm?[.][.....]
What is it, Prince Ephraim?[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]Eirika has never been far[.]
from my side[ToggleMouthMove]--[ToggleMouthMove]in good times and bad.[A]
Without her[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]I'm not sure I could
lead my people back from this disaster.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]I think I understand what you[.]
mean, Prince.[.][A]
When we lost our parents, I was shattered.
Franz helped me get back on my feet.[A]
If I didn't have his help then, I don't[.]
know where I'd be today[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]We are who we are now because they
have always stood by us.[A]
[ToggleSmile][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]Let's end this war quickly, Forde.
For them. Especially for them.[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]Yes.[A]
[0C6D]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x114][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x116][OpenMidLeft]How are you doing, Forde?[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]Me? Oh, I'm fine as long as I've
got a sword in my hand.[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]Oh, by the way, Forde.[A]
When you have some time, would you
[ToggleSmile]show me your painting again?[A][OpenMidRight]You'd like to see it? Why[.]
the sudden interest, Prince?[A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]The scene you painted, it's the[.]
Renais we once knew[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
Those magnificent fields and tranquil[.]
farming villages[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[ToggleSmile]When I look at it, I can forget, for
a second, that we're on a battlefield.[A]
[ToggleSmile]I want to restore the Renais you painted.[.][A]
I want to restore these landscapes that[.]
fill me with joy looking at them.[.][A]
I wanted to see the painting again so[.]
that I could carry it with me in my heart.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]If you like it, Prince Ephraim, I'd[.]
be honored if you would take it.[A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]Really? Are you sure, Forde?[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]Yes, of course. Please take it.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Thank you, Forde! It is truly beautiful.
[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]Did you study painting?[.][A][OpenMidRight]No. I just[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]When we were young,[.]
I would paint for Franz.[A]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]Our father spent much time away, and
Franz wept every night, missing him.[A]
But I was just a child, too. I didn't[.]
know how to make him stop crying.[.][A]
One day, I showed him a drawing that
I'd made of our parents[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
And Franz stopped crying. I've been[.]
painting ever since[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]I see[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]I've a thought[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]In exchange for this
painting, there's something you can do.[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]What is it, Forde?[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]Once you've achieved your goal, once you've[.]
restored Renais to the way it was[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
Can I have a vacation?[A][OpenMidLeft]Is rest all you ever think about? If
you want that vacation, earn it![A][OpenMidRight]Right, right. [ToggleSmile]I'll just keep risking
my life protecting you then, Ephraim.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]You do that. I'm counting[.]
on you, Forde.[A]
[0C6E]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x114][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x126][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]Ephraim.[A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Myrrh! I'm happy to see you.[A]
You're still so young. Don't push[.]
yourself too hard today, all right?[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]I won't[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
I have a favor to ask.
Do you have time for me?[A][OpenMidLeft]What is it, Myrrh?[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Don't be nervous, Myrrh.
You can ask me anything.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]Ephraim[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
May I call you[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
[OpenQuote]brother[CloseQuote]?[A][OpenMidLeft]Wha[.][ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]What?[.][A]
Myrrh[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
What's come over you?[.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]I was watching you and
Eirika together.[A]
You looked so close.[A][OpenMidLeft]Of course we're close. She is[.]
my sister, after all.[.][A][OpenMidRight]I envy her.[.][A]
I[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]wish that I had[.]
a brother like you.[.][A]
That's why I ask[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
Even if just for this journey[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
Please be my brother.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]I don't know what to say[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
I wasn't expecting you to[.]
ask anything like that[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]No[ToggleMouthMove]...?[ToggleMouthMove][A]
I'm sorry. I should[.]
not have asked[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]Oh[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]No, Myrrh[.][ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]Wait.[.][A]
[ToggleSmile]I'm not saying no.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]So, it's all right?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Uhhh[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]Sure.[.][A]
[ToggleSmile]Of course.[......]
If it will make you happy.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes[.][ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]It does.[A]
I'll come speak with you
again soon[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]Brother.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight][ClearFace][......][OpenMidLeft]Oh, my[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
Eirika[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]Myrrh[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
How can I say no to that look?[A]
I guess sisters are my weakness.[A]
[0C6F]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x114][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x126][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Hello[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]Big Brother.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
Myrrh, don't you find that
to be a little awkward?[.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]Is it?[A][OpenMidLeft]I mean[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
[ToggleSmile]You're a dragon, correct?[.][A]
And if I'm right, you're also[.]
far older than I am[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]That's correct[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
So, should I be your big sister?[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Well, that doesn't seem right, either.[A]
You look so much younger than[.]
I do. That would be odd[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]I am[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]very old.[.][A]
Perhaps [OpenQuote]mother[CloseQuote]?[.]
I[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]don't like [OpenQuote]grandmother.[CloseQuote][.][A][OpenMidLeft][CloseEyes][OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]Let's not dwell on this.
[OpenQuote]Sister[CloseQuote] will be fine.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][OpenEyes][OpenMidLeft]Well. Did you have something
you wanted to ask me?[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]I did[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
You see, Brother, I have
a favor to ask of you.[A][OpenMidLeft]Yes?[A][OpenMidRight]In the forest[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]I was always
with my father.[.][A]
Even when I slept, he was there,
watching over me.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Yes?[A][OpenMidRight]So[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]Brother.[A]
Would you[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]stay with me at[.]
night and watch over me?[A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]No![.][A]
[ToggleSmile]Myrrh, I understand your insecurity,
but this simply is not acceptable.[A]
Especially when we are on the march.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]Oh, don't look so sad.[A][Clear]
[ToggleSmile]When you see Eirika next,[.]
why don't you ask her?[A]
I'm sure she will agree.[A]
If you and I are brother and sister, then[.]
surely you and she are sisters, too.[A]
How does that sound?[A][ToggleSmile][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]Yes[.][ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]I'll do that.[.][A]
Thank you, Brother.[.][A]
[0C70]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x114][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x126][OpenMidLeft]Hey, Myrrh[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
When this war is over[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
What will you do?[.][A]
Have you thought about
where you will go?[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
I've lived in Darkling Woods
ever since I was a child.[.][A]
I think that I shall spend
the rest of my life there.[A][OpenMidLeft]On your own?[A]
Do you have anyone waiting
for you in the forest?[A][OpenMidRight]I[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
I am on my own now.[.][A]
But you need not worry.[.]
I am a dragon, after all.[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
I've been thinking, Myrrh.[A]
If you would like, you can
live with us in Renais.[.][A][OpenMidRight]What?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]When this war is over[.][ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]When
we restore peace to Magvel[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
Eirika and I will be going back[.]
to Renais to lead our people.[.][A]
Would you like to live in the[.]
castle? With us?[A][OpenMidRight]Oh, but[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
I would not want to[.]
inconvenience you.[A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]It's nothing you need worry about.
Castle Renais is a vast place.[A]
I'm sure we could spare a room for
a small girl like you.[A]
And besides, you are my sister, right?[A]
Family should stay together,
don't you think?[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
But[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]you must not forget[.]
that I am a dragon.[.][A]
I must think about it.[A]
I would love to, but[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
perhaps I shouldn't, and so[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
I must think about it.[A][OpenMidLeft]As you wish.[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]But[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
Thank you for the offer.
It makes me very happy.[.][A]
Thank you, Brother.[.][A][ToggleSmile]
[0C71]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x114][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x122][OpenMidRight]Oh, Ephraim![A]
Why are you here? Do you
not have somewhere to be?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]I'm sorry?[.....]
What do you mean?[.][A][OpenMidRight]Why don't you go fight someone or[.]
break down a wall or something?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]We all have our roles to play in this[.]
battle. I'm waiting for the right moment.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Are you speaking honestly with me?[A]
Are you not simply making an excuse so
that you have time to chat with me?[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]There's no glory in dragging
out a war without good reason.[A][OpenMidRight]It does me good to hear that.[.][A]
If you or any of your good men are
injured, come to me at once.[A]
I'll wait for you here, and I'll
heal your wounds swiftly.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Yes, well, that's why you're here,
isn't it? We're counting on you.[A]
We fight with confidence only[.]
because we have your healing skills.[A][OpenMidRight]Naturally![A]
And today, I will serve you as
well as I can, as always.[.][A]
Watch for me![.][A][OpenMidRight][ClearFace][.......][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]She seems so reliable[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]

Are women of Rausten [.]
all like that?[A][ToggleSmile]
[0C72]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x114][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x122][OpenMidRight]Ephraim, wait a minute.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Yes?[A][OpenMidRight]I've heard such interesting things
about you from so many people.[A]
I thought it best to ask directly:
You are a reckless man, are you not?[A]
It seems an attitude unbefitting
a commander, wouldn't you say?[A][OpenMidLeft]Don't speak to me that way.[.][A]
If I can save a life by taking
a risk myself, I'll do it.[A]
This is war, and war is risky.
I have no problem with that.[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]Oh, dear.[.][A]
I'll bet your body is just covered
with scars under that armor, isn't it?[A]
I can heal them all for you.
Let me see them.[A][OpenMidLeft]Thanks.[.]
[ToggleSmile]Let's see[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][ToggleSmile][CloseSpeechSlow][......][OpenMidRight][MoveMidRight][OpenMidRight]Oh![.][A]
Oh[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]Oh my![A]
Wh-what are you doing?[A][OpenMidLeft]I have to take my armor off if I'm going
to show you the scar on my shoulder[.][ToggleMouthMove]--[ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]Cad! Beast! Pervert! Devil![.][A]
I simply will NOT allow you to take[.]
advantage of me in my confused state![.][A][OpenMidLeft]Conf[ToggleMouthMove]-- [.][ToggleMouthMove]What!?[A]
Wait, L'Arachel!
What about my scars[.][ToggleMouthMove]...?[ToggleMouthMove][A]

You don't have to be so defensive.
Why don't you come talk to me?[A][OpenFarRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]That depends. You're not going
to try to attack me again, are you?[.][A]
You won't go ripping the armor from[.]
your[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]well-toned body, will you?[A][OpenMidLeft]L'Arachel[.][ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]That was all just[.]
a simple misunderstanding.[A]
But I apologize if I offended your
sensibilities in removing my armor.[.][A][OpenFarRight][MoveMidRight][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Well, I suppose I can forgive you[.]
for this one indiscretion.[A]
I wasn't prepared. I've never seen
a man's naked body before[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Naked[.][ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]I was only showing you the
scar on my shoulder, like you asked![A][OpenMidRight]A naked shoulder is a big deal![.][A]
I was so shocked. Why, I could
hardly sleep at all that night![.][A][OpenMidRight][HalfCloseEyes][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]...?[ToggleMouthMove][A]
What's wrong, L'Arachel?
You seem different somehow.[.][A][OpenMidRight][OpenEyes][OpenMidRight]N-no. Everything is fine[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
Please don't look at me in such[.]
a vulgar, leering way.[A]
I find it very inappropriate.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Oh, I'm sorry. I had no idea.[.]
I certainly would never[.][ToggleMouthMove]--[ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight][MoveMidRight][OpenMidRight]What!?[A]
Are you saying that you do
not find me attractive?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]No! I[.][ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]What do you want me to say?[.][A][OpenMidRight]How can you be so calm at a time like[.]
this? Don't you see what you've done!?[A]
Ahhhh! I'm so frustrated![.][A]
Don't you ever forget this, Ephraim![A]
I hope that, someday, some girl comes[.]
along and gets YOU all rattled, too![A][OpenMidRight][ClearFace][.......][OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]I just do NOT get her.[A]
[ToggleSmile]She is rather cute, though.[.][A][ToggleSmile]
[0C74]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x125][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x114][OpenMidRight]Duessel, can we speak?[A][OpenMidLeft]Oh, Prince Ephraim.[.]
Of course, my friend.[.][A][OpenMidRight]I feel I should apologize for making
you side against Grado in this.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Bah. What nonsense![.][A]
Please, use me however you
would to end this war.[A][OpenMidRight]I want you to know how honored I am[.]
to fight at your side again.[A]
[ToggleSmile]Show me a little of your skill with[.]
the spear, like when you taught me.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Hmm[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
Ephraim, your skills have grown[.]
significantly since then.[.][A]
Why, the first time I met you,
you could hardly hold a spear![A]
I couldn't even bring myself to lie[.]
and say you weren't THAT bad![.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]There's no need to be cruel!
I realize how helpless I was then.[A][OpenMidLeft]Let me finish! Even then, your strong[.]
will was most impressive.[.][A]
On your first day wielding a spear,[.]
you chose to challenge ME![A]
I remember how enthusiastic your attack[.]
was. You were determined to win.[A]
But[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]you were destined to lose that
day. Still, I was quite shocked.[A]
You weren't trying to learn my skill.[.]
You were trying to steal it from me![A]
And I thought an apprentice was[.]
supposed to be obedient to his master.[A][OpenMidRight]When you fight, you must respect your[.]
opponent, not obey him.[.][A]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]Besides, you knocked me out[.]
so quickly, I hardly touched you.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]I never dreamed of testing my skills
against a prince of Renais.[.][A]
After that match, though[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
Oh, I changed my mind.[A]
[ToggleSmile]I knew it would be interesting to teach[.]
my skills to someone like you.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]Now, you're the one speaking nonsense![A]
Ah, I know[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[ToggleSmile]Let's duel again after this battle![.][A]
I'm older now, better trained.
I'm sure I can beat you this time.[A][ToggleSmile][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Hmmm[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]Yes, fine.[A]
I'd like to see if you've been
keeping up with your training.[A]
[0C75]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x114][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x125][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]Duessel, do you have a moment?[A][OpenMidRight]Oh, Ephraim. Of course.[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]Were you thinking about Grado[.]
just now? You looked distracted.[A]
I wonder, was it the wrong decision[.]
to send you fighting against Grado?[.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]You've no need to worry. My reasons[.]
for leaving Grado are my own.[.][A]
It doesn't matter who I'm fighting.[.]
My resolve won't be weakened.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]That is good to hear[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
Actually, I'm here for a rematch.[.][A]
I have no idea how you beat me last[.]
time, but this time, I can do it![.][A][OpenMidRight]Hmm. It looks like you haven't
learned your lesson yet.[A]
You know, they used to call me Obsidian.
I was one of the Imperial Three.[A]
I'm not about to let a young punk[.]
like you best me at the spear![A]
[0C76]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x114][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x125][OpenMidLeft]Phew[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]Nicely done, Ephraim.[.][A]
There's nothing left for
me to teach you, it seems.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]That's utter nonsense. I still have[.]
much to learn from you, Duessel.[A]
I intend to be the greatest[.]
spearman Magvel has ever known.[.][A]
I gave up on swords after seeing
how they fare against spears.[.][A]
Sword, axe, spear, bow[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]and[.]
even magic. I've seen them all.[.][A]
The spear always comes out on top. And
I want mine to be the best spear around.[A][OpenMidRight]Hm[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]That's a bold statement.[A]
But you may yet be the one who
can prove it true, lad.[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]I thank you, Duessel.[.][A]
It's only because of the skills you[.]
gave me that I'm alive and here now.[A]
Our countries were friends, but you[.]
taught me like family[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]I am a warrior. All I can do is improve[.]
my skills and pass them on to a student.[A]
And if you best me using the skills[.]
that I taught you, well[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
That's just the nature of war.
The young surpass the old.[A]
[ToggleSmile]And I am glad to be fighting at the[.]
side of such a worthy student.[A][ToggleSmile][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Duessel[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]I know that I've been branded a[.]
traitor. I'm prepared for that.[.][A]
But I do have one regret[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
I regret that I betrayed my[.]
emperor[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]You never betrayed him.[.][A]
You remain as loyal to him now
as when you swore your oaths.[.][A]
No, it is Grado who has betrayed
the ideals it once held dear.[.][A][Clear]
And now, as then, you are my
teacher. Nothing has changed.[.][A]
No, you are no traitor. If anything,
you are the last true man of Grado.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Ephraim[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[ToggleSmile]Hm[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]Yes. A student should not[.]
inspire his teacher.[A]
Ephraim. Be strong. Remain true.[A]
Believe in yourself, and act in[.]
accordance with your beliefs.[.][A]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]No matter what happens,[.]
be a strong king.[.][A][ToggleSmile][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Yes, you needn't worry about that.[A]
Such has been my intention since
the day I first held this spear.[A]
No matter what the future holds[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
I'm never going to change.[A]
I will let my faith and my beliefs
drive my every action as king.[A]
[0C77]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x114][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x12C][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Oh, Ephraim![A]
I'm so glad to see you.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Tana, you should pull back to[.]
a safer location.[.][A]
What would we do if you were
attacked by archers?[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]But[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]I want to go
where you go.[.][A]
I feel safer when I'm[.]
close to you, Ephraim.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]I'm sorry, but I won't be able to[.]
protect you if I get into a duel.[.][A]
I have to focus on fighting our[.]
enemies.[A][OpenMidRight]Oh, no[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]Please, Ephraim, don't
speak to me like that.[A]
I've trained with Frelia's finest[.]
pegasus knights. I can fight, too![A][OpenMidLeft]But[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]I'm sorry if I've been following
you too closely lately[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
But I promise that I won't be[.]
a burden. I'll work my hardest.[.][A]
So, please![.][A]
Don't make me stay behind and[.]
wait for you.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Tana[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[ToggleSmile]All right. If it's what you[.]
want. We'll go together.[A][ToggleSmile]
[0C78]
[ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x114][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x12C][OpenMidRight]Ephraim, do you remember
when we first met?[A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]Ah, of course! It was at Castle[.]
Frelia, wasn't it?[A]
Eirika and I had been invited to visit
for your birthday celebration.[A][OpenMidRight][MoveMidRight][OpenMidRight]Oh, I'm so glad you remembered![.][A][OpenMidLeft]King Hayden seemed so delighted[.]
that we'd come to visit.[A]
I think that was the first time[.]
I met Innes, too.[.][A][OpenMidRight]So, Ephraim, what did you think[.]
of the dress I was wearing?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]I[.][ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]Hm[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
I'm sorry, but I don't think I got
a good look at it at the time.[A]
Perhaps you don't remember, but as soon[.]
as I arrived, Innes challenged me.[A]
We ended up having an archery match[.]
right when the party began.[.][A]
I think Innes won that match.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Do you remember my hair?
I was so happy with it![.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Your[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]hair? Uh[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
Well, right after our archery match,
Innes challenged me to the spear.[.][A]
[ToggleSmile]I think I won that match![.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I'll bet you don't even remember
what I said afterward![A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Er, Innes can be persistent. After
spears, we moved on to jousting.[A]
That time, I think it was[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight][MoveMidRight][OpenMidRight]Oh, you! You only remember what[.]
happened with my brother![.][A]
You don't care about me at all,[.]
do you!?[A][OpenMidLeft]Oh, no, no! That's not true.
It's just[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]Fine! Why should I care about you when you
can't even be bothered to care about me?[A]
You just keep having fun with my brother
and don't pay me any mind at all![.][A][OpenMidRight][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft]Tana, wait a minute! Hey![.]
Don't go off on your own![.][A]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]What is she so upset about?[.][A]
[0C79]
[ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x114][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x12C][OpenMidRight]Hello, Ephraim. Shall[.]
we take a break together?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Well, you're in a better mood today![A][OpenMidRight]Huh? What do you mean?[A][OpenMidLeft]Oh, nothing. Never mind.[A]
So, uh, what can I do for you?[A][OpenMidRight]Eirika helped me prepare lunch. I haven't[.]
tried it yet, but I'm sure it's delicious.[A]
Would you like to eat with me?[A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]Tana. This is a battlefield.[A]
It's all right to take a break, but[.]
let's not let our guards down.[A][ToggleSmile][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
You're always like that.[A]
You're so stiff and formal
and detached all the time.[A][OpenMidLeft]Tana[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
What's the matter with you?[.][A]
You've been acting so odd[.]
lately.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Yes, I am acting funny. And it's
all your fault, Ephraim![A]
Whenever I try to talk to you,
you always keep your distance![A]
No matter how hard I try,[.]
you never open up to me.[A][OpenMidLeft]That's not true[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]Is there someone else?[A][OpenMidLeft]What[ToggleMouthMove]...?[ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]It's just[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
You never pay any attention[.]
to me. You never have[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
It makes me so sad.[.][A]
All I want to do is be near[.]
you more and more.[A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[ToggleSmile]Tana, you're still just a[.]
child at heart, aren't you?[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]Ephraim! Don't talk about[.]
me like that[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]No, I meant it as a compliment.[.][A]
Because you're so young, your words[.]
have such a simple, honest purity[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
I do appreciate your affection.[.][A][ToggleSmile][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Ephraim[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[ToggleSmile]Do you think you could make more
time for me, so we can chat?[A][OpenMidLeft]Yes[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]of course.[A]
But we don't have the luxury to[.]
stop and chat on the battlefield.[.][A]
We have an obligation to end this[.]
war first. Let's go.[A][OpenMidRight]Yes, all right.[.][A]
I'll see you later. I'm[.]
looking forward to it.[A]
[0C7A]
[ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x104][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x106][OpenMidRight]General![A][OpenMidLeft]Franz. How are you
holding up?[.][A][OpenMidRight]Fine. I may be young, but I'm every[.]
bit a Knight of Renais.[.][A]
I'll fight to the end to protect the
princess, just like you, sir![.][A][OpenMidLeft]Good, good! That's the spirit![A]
You know, you're looking much[.]
improved from when we set out.[A][OpenMidRight]Hm. Do you really think[.]
so, General?[A][OpenMidLeft]Oh, definitely. You seem much more sure[.]
of yourself. All doubt has left your face.[A]
By the time you reach my age, you'll be[.]
the finest spear- and swordsman around.[.][A][OpenMidRight][MoveMidRight][OpenMidRight]Honestly? Sir, do you[.]
really believe that?[A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]I do[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
[ToggleSmile]But we are in a battle right now, Franz.[A]
Concentrate on the enemies before you,
and don't get too cocky.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes, sir!!![.][A]
You know I'd never
let you down, sir![A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Don't be too eager for
success. Know your limits.[A][OpenMidRight]Yes, sir![.][A]
[0C7B]
[ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x104][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x106][OpenMidRight]General![A][OpenMidLeft]Ah, Franz. Every time I see you,
you're getting better and better.[.][A]
Your parry is a little stiff, but[.]
you are clearly improving.[A][OpenMidRight]Are you serious? Do you[.]
really think so, sir?[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]Why is it that, when I compliment[.]
you, you always ask me that?[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Oh, so sorry[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
[ToggleSmile]I appreciate your praise, sir.[A]
I mean, you're General Seth, the
Silver Knight. You're my hero.[A][OpenMidLeft]Hahaha[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
No more flattery, Franz. Please.[A][OpenMidRight]But, General, it's true![A][OpenMidRight][MoveRight][OpenRight]Do you remember when Grado's forces[.]
overran Castle Renais?[A]
Despite grave injuries, you outcharged
the enemy, broke their lines, and escaped.[A]
And then, you delivered the princess,[.]
on your own, to Frelia safely.[A]
If I were you, I doubt I could have[.]
survived such a challenge[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
You are the only person I know who can
make impossible feats possible.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]What pressure you put on me! How
can I possibly fail now?[A]
You would lose all faith in me![.]
Ah, but, Franz, you're still young.[.][A]
You will grow into a remarkable[.]
warrior, I have no doubt.[.][A]
Be confident. I'm counting on you.
Train your mind and hone your skills.[.][A][OpenRight]Really? Do you really[.]
think so, General?[A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]Franz[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
That's enough.[A][OpenRight][MoveMidRight][OpenMidRight]Oh, right! Sorry, sir![A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]All right, back into the
fray! Let's go, Franz![A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes, General! And remember,[.]
I've got your back![.][A][ToggleSmile]
[0C7C]
[ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x104][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x106][OpenMidLeft]You're doing well, Franz.[.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Oh, General!![.]
How are you, sir?[.][A]
[ToggleSmile]I'm so honored that you[.]
came to talk to me.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Must you always overreact?[A]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]Honestly, Franz[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
I'm the one who should feel honored.[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I beg your pardon?[.....]
What do you mean, sir?[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]When I was just a squire, there was one[.]
knight whom I admired above all others.[.][A]
His skill with sword and spear was
legendary. He was truly peerless.[.][A]
We squires learned the meaning of[.]
chivalry watching him serve the king.[.][A][Clear]
[ToggleSmile]Ten years back, we received word that an
infamous assassin was hiding in Renais.[.][A]
This knight hunted him down in secrecy
so as not to alert the assassin.[A]
He hounded the villain and killed[.]
him, but he was mortally wounded[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][ToggleSmile][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]Ten years ago? But that's when[ToggleMouthMove]--!?[ToggleMouthMove][A][CloseSpeechSlow][OpenMidRight][MoveMidRight][OpenMidRight]No, it couldn't be[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]Yes, Franz.[.][A]
It was the greatest knight in the[.]
history of Renais. Your father.[.][A][ToggleSmile][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]I was so young when my father died.[.][A]
And our mother passed away before he did.[.]
Forde and I were almost always alone.[.][A]
Oh, I remember how I used to cry like a[.]
babe about my father being gone so much.[A]
Forde would always remind me, [OpenQuote]He is serving
the royal family to protect Renais.[CloseQuote][A]
Forde was so proud of our father, but he
was also a little bit sad.[A]
I remember a deep scar he had on his
shoulder, probably in battle.[.][A]
My brother and I used to climb up his[.]
shoulders and vie for his attention.[A]
I grew up hearing what a great knight he
was, but I remember only his shoulder.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]You probably have no idea how[.]
much you resemble your father.[A]
Your swordplay, how you tilt the lance,[.]
your loyalty to Renais[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
You've certainly inherited your[.]
father's spirit.[A]
It is an honor to see the skill I once
idolized developing in you, his son.[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]I am so flattered to hear that.[.]
Thank you very much, General.[.][A]
[ToggleSmile]Someday, I will become a knight even
greater than my brother or my father.[.][A]
To restore Renais, the kingdom to which[.]
I've sworn my blade, I will fight on![.][A][OpenMidLeft]Thank you, Franz. Let's do the best we
can. For Renais, and for your father.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Yes, General![.][A]
[0C7D]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x10E][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x104][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Sir Garcia.[.][A]
Your fighting form remains impeccable,
despite your years of retirement.[.][A]
Fantastic[.][ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]How I admire you.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]No, General Seth, I still have a long[.]
way to go. I've lost so much time.[A][OpenMidRight]Sir Garcia[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]No, no honorifics. I gave up my title[.]
years ago so I could raise my son.[A]
I'm old and rusty, General. The man I am
now is not fit for such fine company.[.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]But listen, General.[A]
I'm not finished yet![.][A][OpenMidRight]What do you mean?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]I'm telling you[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
I'm not yet done![.]
This is not the end of me![A][OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][.......][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]He has a warrior's heart.[.][A]
Is it pride that keeps him from[.]
accepting his limitations?[A]
I'm afraid that we have awakened [.]
an incredible warrior.[A]
[0C7E]
[ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x104][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x10E][OpenMidRight]General.[A][OpenMidLeft]Garcia.[.][A]
Did you come all this way to talk[.]
to me? I'm grateful. Thank you.[.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Don't make a fuss. Might give me second[.]
thoughts before I do it again.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Ah, right. Sorry, sir![A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]Heh[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
You know, you remind me of
myself as a young man.[A][OpenMidLeft]Back when you were in Renais?[.][A][OpenMidRight]That's right. Oh, I was so ambitious then,
focused on proving myself in battle.[A]
His Majesty commended my valor many[.]
times, he did.[A][OpenMidLeft]His Majesty always watched over us.[.][A]
Hardworking soldiers received words of
praise to drive them to greater glories.[A]
The lazy ones, he spurred to action,
giving them a reason to improve[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
He was a great king. He earned the trust
and respect of his people.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]What a loss we've all suffered.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]When Castle Renais fell, it was all I[.]
could do to save Princess Eirika.[.][A]
I've never felt so powerless in[.]
all my time as a knight[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]I was mortified.[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]I'm sorry. I wasn't blaming[.]
you for King Fado's death.[A]
I am the one who surrendered his duty[.]
to live a carefree life with his son.[.][A]
I have no right to cast blame on
anyone but myself[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]Garcia, you needn't feel that way.[A]
You're fighting for Renais again, at the
side of her crown prince and princess![A]
There's no shame in that.[.][A][OpenMidRight]General Seth[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]If you are still true to our late king,[.]
then let's win this war together.[.][A]
And together, we shall visit His

[ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x10E][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x104][OpenMidRight]Garcia.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Ah, General Seth![.][A][OpenMidRight]You seem much recovered from your[.]
poor spirits the other day.[.][A]
In fact, you seem quite energetic![A][OpenMidLeft]I've finally accepted that I'm only[.]
ever truly alive when I'm fighting![.][A][OpenMidRight]Ah, now that is the great Garcia
I remember from my youth![.][A]
Yes, all hesitation is gone from
your face. You're in rare form![.][A][OpenMidLeft]Yes, and that hesitation is gone
for good, I dare say. Except[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]Yes?[A][OpenMidLeft]To tell you the truth[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]I am not
ashamed of the life I've lived.[.][A]
I'm not sorry that I abandoned my[.]
old life to raise my son.[.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Sir Garcia[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][ToggleSmile][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]That decision made me who I am now.[.][A]
It's time I embraced both of these
aspects of my past.[.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]I can only say this in hindsight, but[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
It is not so bad [.][ToggleSmile]to have a family.[.][A][ToggleSmile][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]Garcia, I can see it in your eyes.
You don't need to tell me.[A][OpenMidLeft]Heh[.][ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]I see! Well then, Seth.[.]
There is only one solution for it![A]
You should marry! It will do you good[.]
to have a family to go home to.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Ah, Garcia[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
You may be right, but I'm afraid it will
take me some time to get there[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[0C80]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x111][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x104][OpenMidLeft]Oh, General Seth, how do you do?[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]Sister Natasha, good day to you.[A]
I appreciate the care you give our wounded,[.]
but be sure to care for yourself, too.[A]
I heard about what happened the other[.]
day. It could have turned out badly[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]I'm sorry to have worried you. When[.]
I see an injured person, I must help.[.][A]
I seldom think of the consequences
to myself.[A]
I shall be more careful in the future.[A][OpenMidRight]Grado doesn't know what they've lost,[.]
Natasha. You're indispensable to us.[A]
If you were injured, our entire strategy
could be slowed or lost altogether.[.][A]
Take care of yourself first, and
worry about us later.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Seth, you are the one who is
indispensable, far more than I am.[A]
You race into danger, acting as a[.]
decoy or rescuing people alone.[.][A]
You're the one who is reckless.[.]
I wish you would watch yourself.[A][OpenMidRight]I'm sorry. I didn't realize I'd[.]
been causing you so much worry.[.][A]
I promise to be less reckless. But
you, don't do anything I wouldn't do.[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yes, General. May you be
guided to safety.[.][A][ToggleSmile]
[0C81]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x111][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x104][OpenMidRight]Sister Natasha? Are you well? I heard[.]
you collapsed last night.[.][A]
Maybe you should rest more, instead[.]
of risking yourself on[ToggleMouthMove]--[ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]Oh, General Seth[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
I'm sorry about that[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
We had many wounded, and I drained
myself healing them all.[A]
However, I rested well last night,
and I am fully recovered.[.][A]
I'm sorry for giving you so much
cause to worry once again.[A][OpenMidRight]Oh, boy[.][ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]You and Eirika[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
What am I going to do about you?[A]
You seem hell-bent on throwing
away your lives in this conflict.[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]Oh, I see[.][ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]I always become[.]
a liability in battle.[A]
All I do is cause you worry and[.]
concern.[A][OpenMidRight]You're always the first to race into
battle to heal an injured person.[.][A]
Do you know what the others have
started calling you?[A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]They're calling me names?[.][A][OpenMidRight]They've taken to calling you [OpenQuote]the[.]
healing spirit.[CloseQuote][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]A healing spirit? Oh, no[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
I'm far from it. Why, I[.][ToggleMouthMove]--[ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]When you first joined us, I was[.]
not sure I could trust my life to you.[A]
You're from Grado, and we've seen the[.]
treacheries of which they are capable.[A]
But I've watched you, and I know now
that I was wrong.[.][A]
[ToggleSmile]I'm grateful for the kindness and[.]
compassion that you've showed us all.[.][A]
My men are right. You are a healing[.]
spirit, sent to rejuvenate us all.[A]
We're fortunate to have you as our
friend.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]Friend[ToggleMouthMove]...?[ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]More than a friend. You are an
irreplaceable asset to our cause.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Oh, my[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
I'm sorry[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]Please, return to the battle.[.]
And may you be guided to safety.[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]Sister Natasha[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
If I am injured, I will not be reckless.
I will race to your side.[.][A]
And I know that you will take care
of me when that happens.[A][OpenMidLeft]Y-yes, of course I will!
Oh, but[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]I hope that it doesn't.[.][A]
[0C82]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x111][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x104][OpenMidLeft]General Seth.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Sister Natasha. How are you?[A][OpenMidLeft]Well, thank you. And you?[.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes, I'm fine.[A]
But it's only because you've
been beside me as I've fought.[A]
You were always the one to
heal my broken body.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]You have that wrong, General. You're
the one constantly rescuing me.[.][A]
When I'm surrounded by enemies, when
I'm separated from the others[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]Sister Natasha[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]Do you plan on
returning to Grado someday?[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]Yes. I must return to the temple.[.]
Our people need my services.[A][OpenMidRight]Is that[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]what you really want?[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]General Seth[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]Could anything sway you to
stay in Renais instead?[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][.....]
General Seth, what are you[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][.....]
I'm sorry. I'm[ToggleMouthMove]--[ToggleMouthMove][A]
I'll be more direct.
Sister Natasha[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
When this war is over would[.]
you[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]come live with me?[A][OpenMidLeft]Oh![.][A]
But, Seth[.][ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]I'm a cleric.[.]
I'm sworn never to[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]I know you're a cleric. You've given
your life over to a divine calling.[.][A]
But would the Everlasting not smile[.]
upon the love shared by its creations?[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]Seth, I[.][ToggleMouthMove]--[ToggleMouthMove]
Yes, I believe so.[A][OpenMidRight]I vow upon the sacred oaths you have
sworn that I will make you happy.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Seth[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]I hope you
keep that promise.[A]
I'll wait for you until this
war is finally at an end.[.][A][OpenMidRight]I will keep my promise, Natasha.[A]
I will.[.][A]
[0C83]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x104][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x113][OpenMidRight]You're pretty good with a spear.[A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Thank you.[A]
I don't think I've introduced myself.[.]
I'm the leader of the Knights of Renais[.][ToggleMouthMove]--[ToggleMouthMove][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]I know you. Of course I know you.[.]
You're General Seth, the Silver Knight.[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]Yes, that's right.[A]
And you are Cormag, the renowned
wyvern rider of Grado.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]If the legendary Silver Knight knows
my name, I can't be doing too bad, huh?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]You and your brother, Glen, are famous
even among the Knights of Renais.[.][A]
We have no wyvern riders in Renais, and[.]
your stories are favorites among the men.[.][A]
I've been watching your combat style
since you joined our forces.[A][OpenMidRight]Oh, is that so? Well, tell
me: what do you think?[A][OpenMidLeft]I'd love a chance to spar with you.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Not a chance. I could[.]
never beat you.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]So you say, but I can see in your eyes
that you'll never accept failure.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Heh[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][.....][A]
And all this time, I thought you
were just another loyal dullard.[A]
Guess I was wrong. We should
chat some more sometime.[A][OpenMidLeft]Yes, I think I'd like that.[.][A]
Perhaps once things have eased up.
I'm looking forward to it, Cormag.[A][OpenMidRight]Sure thing.[.][A]
[0C84]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x113][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x104][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Hey, Seth.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Ah, Cormag. Good timing.[A]
I had something I wanted to ask you.
Your family, are they all soldiers?[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Why do you ask?[.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Your skill with the spear is amazing.[.]
Have you trained since you were a child?[A][ToggleSmile][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]No, I come from a long line of dirt-poor
farmers. I wielded a plough, not a spear.[.][A]
When we were kids, Glen and I had to
chase birds and animals from our fields.[A]
We used sticks and stones, and I think
that helped with our aim, to be honest.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Is that so[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
So why did you join the army?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]It's a funny story, really.[.][A]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]The emperor's caravan passed through
our village one day.[A]
My brother and I watched the glorious[.]
procession from the top of a tree.[A]
[ToggleSmile]Then, a stray dog started to harry the
horses pulling the emperor's carriage.[A]
We threw rocks to drive off the mutt,[.]
but some soldiers decided to arrest us.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]Why? You were trying to help[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]Yes, well. We didn't just hit the dog.
We got a few of the soldiers as well.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Ah-ha[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
So, what happened next?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Well, the emperor shows up in the room
the soldiers had thrown us.[.][A]
He looks around and, in this very calm
but stern voice, says to the soldiers:[A]
"What are you men doing, arresting mere[.]
children? They were trying to help!"[A]
Then, he invites us to dine at his table,[.]
and it was a luxurious feast, I tell you![.][A]
Now, we were just kids. We lacked the[.]
basic courtesies. We were just filthy.[A]
And we kept droning on about the most[.]
idiotic things: chores, the village[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
But he listened to us intently, and[.]
that fatherly smile never left his face.[A]
And he said, [OpenQuote]You lads are good at
driving off dogs with stones[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
Your skills are wasted in the fields. Let's[.]
see how you fare with spears instead.[CloseQuote][A][OpenMidRight]And that's how you were recruited.[A][OpenMidLeft]Exactly. It's difficult to ignore[.]
such a commanding presence.[.][A]
But[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]the emperor changed. I still
can't believe what's happened.[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]I was born into a family of knights, so[.]
it was a given that I should be one, too.[.][A]
I trained in spear and sword. I studied[.]
chivalry and swore my oaths of fealty.[A]
And because of my hard work, the late[.]
King Fado treated me like a second son.[.][A]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]It's funny. You and I are from different
worlds, but we share the same loyalties.[A][OpenMidLeft]True[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
But King Fado is dead now.[A]
And my emperor is the one[.]
who killed him[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
My emperor is as good[.]
as dead to me.[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]I already serve a new lord.[.][A]
Cormag, you will find a ruler[.]
worthy of your loyalties, too.[A][OpenMidLeft]Yeah, I hope so[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[0C85]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x104][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x113][OpenMidLeft]Can I have a word with you, Cormag?[.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Oh, Seth. Of course.
What can I do for you?[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]I've been thinking about your story,
and I've come to a decision.[A][OpenMidRight]Hm? What are you talking about?[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]Cormag, listen.[.][A]
As general of the Knights of Renais,
I'd like to offer you a post.[.][A][OpenMidRight]What? You want me to join[.]
the Knights of Renais?[A][OpenMidLeft]Yes, exactly.[.][A]
I've been watching you fight, and I've
been thinking about this for some time.[.][A]
Since we've been speaking, I've seen
more than just your fighting prowess.[.][A]
I've seen that you're a strong and
noble person as well.[.][A]
You are a man I would risk my life
fighting beside.[A]
Prince Ephraim will be a great king.
Would you fight for him with me?[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I really appreciate it.[.]
Thanks, Seth.[.][A]
[ToggleSmile]But[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]Grado is my home. I can't trade[.]
loyalties to Renais just like that.[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]I knew you would say that.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]Emperor Vigarde is my only lord.[A]
My duty now is to correct the[.]
mistakes he has made.[.][A]
That's why I'm here. I hope[.]
you can understand.[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yes, of course[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
Still, I'm glad that I met you.[.][A][ToggleSmile][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]Same here, Seth. Now, let's get[.]
this war over with, shall we?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Yes, and when it's done, we'll get
together and tell some stories.[.][A][OpenMidRight]I'm looking forward to it![A]
[0C86]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x105][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x106][OpenMidRight]Say, Sir Gilliam, can[.]
I ask you a question?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]What is it, Franz?[A][OpenMidRight]Are you disturbed about 
fighting with me?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Why would you say something like that?[A][OpenMidRight]You and I are from different lands.[.]
We have different backgrounds[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
I thought that might've made
you feel uncomfortable.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Blast. I don't need to answer that.[.][A][OpenMidRight][MoveRight][OpenRight]Sir Gilliam![A][OpenMidLeft]Listen: I'm here by my king's order, and
by his order alone.[.][A]
I'm well aware that we have diverse[.]
backgrounds and experiences.[A]
I don't care who I pair up with. You can't
always have your own way.[.][A]
That's just how it works in Frelia. It's
luck of the draw, you follow?[.][A]
Do they let you swap partners until you[.]
find that special someone back in Renais?[.][A][OpenRight][MoveMidRight][OpenMidRight]Oh, no! No, no, no[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]That's
not what I meant.[.][A]
It's just[.][ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]I was worried that I might be[.]
slowing you down with my lesser skills.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Franz, you're wasting your time worrying
when there are better things to be done.[A][OpenMidRight]Like what?[A][OpenMidLeft]Like training, of course.[.][A]
Quit your worrying and show me how
good a Knight of Renais can be.[.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I could ask for nothing[.]
better. Please![.][A][ToggleSmile]
[0C87]
[ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x106][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x105][OpenMidRight]Franz, I can see your[.]
training has paid off.[A][OpenMidLeft]Yes, and I have to say, I'm surprised.
I feel the energy flowing through me.[.][A]
I think it's because of my resistance[.]
training, actually.[.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Frelia's resistance training, you mean.[.][A]
You mean to tell me that you have[.]
no training like that in Renais?[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]We do have a system to strengthen our 
chest, arms, shoulders, and legs.[.][A]
However, that's where we stop. We don't[.]
train each individual finger[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Every muscle acts in relation to each other[.]
muscle. How can you neglect the fingers?[A]
That's how we Frelians think.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Fascinating how our countries can have
such distinct training systems, isn't it?[.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]And you've been training with our system
every day without a single complaint![.][A]
I'm impressed.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Oh, that's because, each night before[.]
I go to sleep[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
I do our traditional relaxation exercises.[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Relaxation exercises?[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Before going to bed, flex each muscle you[.]
used, and you'll wake up feeling refreshed.[.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]What, no fatigue the following day?[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]That's right. That's what it's for.[.][A][OpenMidRight]That's wonderful![.][A][OpenMidLeft]I can teach you if you like.[A][OpenMidRight]Please.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Fantastic! We'll start tonight![.][A]
[0C88]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x105][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x106][OpenMidLeft]Well, Franz, it looks like there's
a lot I can learn from Renais.[A][OpenMidRight]Why the change of heart, Sir Gilliam?[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]I've been doing your exercises every
night, and I feel fantastic.[A][OpenMidRight]I'm glad you like it.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]I appreciate Renais much
more, thanks to you.[A][OpenMidRight]Really?[.][....]
I'm glad.[.][A]
I'm thrilled that the great Sir Gilliam[.]
approves of the training in Renais.[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Thrilled? You're overreacting.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]No, honestly! I am thrilled. It's[.]
a small thing, I know[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
But when someone recognizes the fine
qualities of Renais, I get a thrill.[A]
Renais is a small country, but it[.]
contains much that is good.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]I don't know Renais, but I do know
how you feel as a fellow knight.[A]
The more we are away, the more we[.]
think back on our beloved homeland.[.][A][OpenMidRight]I'm glad that I'm not alone in this.[A][OpenMidLeft]Chin up, lad. Be proud of your country,[.]
Franz, Knight of Renais.[A]
As your friend from neighboring Frelia,[.]
I'm glad you're proud of your home.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Yes, Sir Gilliam![.]
Thank you very much![A]
[0C89]
[ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x111][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x106][OpenMidRight]Sister Natasha.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Hello, Franz.[.]
How are you doing?[A][OpenMidRight]I'm doing fine, thank you.
Everything is fine.[.][A]
And you look like you're doing
well, too. I'm relieved.[A][OpenMidLeft]Yes, but it's all thanks to everyone's
care and concern, really.[.][A]
I'm grateful for all the attention
everyone has paid to my safety.[.][A]
That goes for you, too, Franz.[A][OpenMidRight]Oh, pshaw, Sister Natasha. I am just
a pawn, really. I don't do much[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]You are too modest, Franz.
I'm telling you the truth.[A][OpenMidRight]Thank you.[A][OpenMidLeft]By the way, that's a very[.]
interesting satchel you have.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Huh?[A][OpenMidLeft]It's not military issue, is it?[.][A]
I haven't seen any of the other[.]
cavaliers carrying one like it.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Oh, this old thing? To tell you[.]
the truth, I made it myself.[A][OpenMidLeft]Really?[.][A][OpenMidRight]Yes. This pouch holds a skin of water,
and this pocket is for food.[A]
There's also a pocket for herbs[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
I can find everything very quickly.[.][A]
Oh, and I've also fixed it so that it[.]
won't shake about while I'm riding.[.][A]
It's easy to carry on one shoulder or sling[.]
over both. And it goes with everything.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]That's nice!
You're so handy.[A][OpenMidRight]Thank you.
It's[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]probably my only redeeming trait.[.][A]
Uh[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]Would you like one?[.]
I can make one for you.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Really?[.]
That would be wonderful.[A]
But[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]are you sure?[.][A][OpenMidRight]Yes, of course.[.]
No problem.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Thank you, Franz.[.][A]

[OpenMidRight][MoveMidRight][OpenMidRight]It looks good. Much better than[.]
when I do it myself[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
Franz, you truly are a
remarkably handy person.[A]
When you're near me, I find[.]
myself comforted by your presence.[A][OpenMidLeft]Don't be silly. The pleasure's mine.[A][OpenMidRight]No, I mean it. Thank you.[.][A]

I'm still such an amateur[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]You're serious and focused, Franz.[A]
You grow stronger every day, and
you're sure to be a wonderful knight![.][A][OpenMidRight]Thank you[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
But I've never excelled in either the[.]
spear or sword, and I'm a small man.[A]
I'm not much when compared to the[.]
likes of our other men.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]There are many types of knights.[A]
Some are strong, some are swift,
and others are intelligent.[.][A]
You possess a wonderful talent
that no other man can match.[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Me[ToggleMouthMove]...?[ToggleMouthMove][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Yes. You have a pure heart.[.][A]
It is stronger than any spear, and
it possesses its own brand of power.[A]
You should have more confidence.[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Sister Natasha[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]

Oh, that's[ToggleMouthMove]--[ToggleMouthMove][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]Yes, it's my mother's comb.[.][A]
I would like it if you
chose to keep it with you.[A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Franz[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]I've let myself believe that it[.]

Franz[.][ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]The only reason I fight on with[.]
confidence is because you are with me.[A][ToggleSmile][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]Well[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]that's just not true.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]No, I'm serious.[A]
You see, for me, you are the
person who makes me feel[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
Well, strong. Strong and confident.[.][A]
Your presence is better than a
good-luck charm or anything else.[.][A]
I hope that you and I spend more time[.]
together, fighting for this just cause.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Yes![A]
Thank you for all your kind words.
I certainly hope so, too.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Together, let's restore peace to all
countries, not just Renais and Grado.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Yes, Sister Natasha.[A]
It is a noble cause, and we[.]
will bring victory![.][A][OpenMidLeft]Then let's fight. For victory[.]
and for friendship.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Yes, my lady![.][A]
[0C8C]
[ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x116][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x106][OpenMidRight]Brother.[A][OpenMidLeft]Hey, Franz.[.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I'm glad to see you're still
in one piece![.][A]
[ToggleSmile]After that last battle, I was[.]
starting to get a little worried.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]I'm glad you're all right, too.[.]
Good job out there, by the way.[.][A]
Your fighting form is perfect.[A][OpenMidRight]Thanks, Forde.[A]
[ToggleSmile]I keep thinking about this war[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
What do you think will happen?[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Dunno. I mean, whatever[.]
happens happens, right?[.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Always quick with a joke[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
But I'm serious this time.
What do you think?[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Hey, I was being serious.[.][A]
We are the best and brightest of our
age, but we face overwhelming numbers.[A]
If you ask me, all I can say is that
I hope we win.[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]It takes more than just hoping for it.[A]
We need to FIGHT for it. We are Knights[.]
of Renais, and it's our duty to fight.[A][ToggleSmile][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Sigh[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]You're so serious.
You're just like Kyle.[A]
If you take the battle too seriously,[.]
you're sure to make a mistake.[A][OpenMidRight]You think so[ToggleMouthMove]...?[ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Of course![A]
It's good to be responsible, but you
have more pressing concerns at times.[.][A][ToggleSmile][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]All right, Brother. I know
what you're saying.[.][A][ToggleSmile]
[0C8D]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x116][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x106][OpenMidRight]Brother[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
Are you painting again?[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Hm? Yes, well[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]it's a hobby.[.][A]
You fish, don't you?[A][OpenMidRight]Yes.[A][OpenMidLeft]What do you like about fishing?[.][A][OpenMidRight]Well[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]it's different than hunting[.]
for other animals. More patient.[A]
And yet, when I hold a fishing pole,
I feel my spear arm is getting stronger.[A][OpenMidLeft]When you're off duty, you should stop[.]
thinking about spears and swords.[.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]There's more[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]Yeah?[.][A][OpenMidRight]I feel at peace.[A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]Hm.[.][A]
Fishing sounds nice. Lets you relax,
purge your heart of the battlefield.[A][OpenMidRight]Yes, exactly.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]And that is important, isn't it?[A]
In battle or in daily life, you[.]
just have to stop and rest, right?[A]
Hey, you should take a break sometime[.]
and go fishing around here![.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Ha! In the middle of a war?[.]
You can't be serious.[.][A]
How could I possibly do that?[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Hey, I'm not saying you should go[.]
right in the middle of a battle.[A]
Do it when you're off duty. Maybe you[.]
can help replenish our food supplies.[.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Really?[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Sure, yeah.[.][A]
You go catch us a big fish,[.]
and I'll eat it. It's a deal![.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Huh?
Oh[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]right.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Now, I've something to look forward to.[.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Hm[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]Was this all just about[.]
you getting some fresh fish to eat?[.][A][ToggleSmile]
[0C8E]
[ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x116][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x106][OpenMidRight]Brother.[A][OpenMidLeft]Franz, that was the best
fish I ever tasted. Thanks.[.][A][OpenMidRight]I was feeling guilty a little[.]
while I was fishing though.[.][A]
I was off duty, but still[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]we are
in the middle of war.[.][A]
I guess it's fine. General Seth seemed
to like it well enough, too.[A][OpenMidLeft]Yup. And as long as everyone's
happy, there's no harm done.[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
Brother. I've realized something.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Huh? What's that?[.][A][OpenMidRight]You are my role model.[A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Franz, what's with you?[.]
All of a sudden, you[ToggleMouthMove]--[ToggleMouthMove][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]No, it's not sudden at all.[.][A]
Come to think of it, I became a[.]
soldier so I could be like you.[.][A]
And now, I'm going to work harder,
so I can be a great knight like you.[A][OpenMidLeft]That[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
That doesn't make any sense. Have you[.]
seen how lazy I am? Seriously.[A]
There are MUCH better role models out[.]
there for you to hero-worship.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]No, no. You like to act lazy. It's
part of your charm, isn't it?[.][A]
But once the battle starts, everyone
sees how sharp a warrior you are.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Is that so?[.][A][OpenMidRight]Yes, it is. And I also know that you
like to play the part of the fool[.][A]
for no other reason than to give these
weary soldiers a reason to smile.[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]And your sword and spear skills surpass[.]
those of any knight in the service of[.][A]
Renais, Frelia, or any other kingdom.[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Wow. Your flattery is far more
than I deserve[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]The only reason you paint is to acquire[.]
a better understanding of geography,[A]
so that you can use that knowledge
in battle[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Nah[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
It's just a hobby.[A]
Don't give me too much credit.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]I'm not.[A]
Think about it. You only paint
landscapes, isn't that true?[A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]The last portrait I ever painted
was of Mother[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]Mother?[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Never mind. Not important.
Anyway, I'm shocked. SHOCKED.[.][A]
Yeah, if you need a role model,[.]
look to General Seth.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]Of course I admire General Seth.[A]
But that's just admiration.[.]
[ToggleSmile]You're still my role model.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
Well, I can't tell you what to think.[.]
I just hope you don't regret this later.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]Don't worry. I won't.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Hm. Whatever you say.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Yes.
So, that's that.[A]
Now, make sure you don't get
yourself killed in a fight.[.][A]
Bye.[A][OpenMidRight][ClearFace][.......][OpenMidLeft]Franz[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][Clear]
I need you to survive this war.[.]
You and I will go home together.[A]
When this war is over, you and I
will go home and rebuild our lives.[.][A]
[0C8F]
[ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x119][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x106][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Oh, hello there. You're[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][.....]
[ToggleSmile]Ah, it's Amelia, isn't it?[A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Hm? Oh[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
[ToggleSmile]Yes, and you're Franz![A][OpenMidRight]That's right. How are you?
Getting the hang of things?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Oh, yes. Quite![.][A]
You know, everyone here is so much
friendlier than the folks in Grado.[.][A]
I'm glad there are so many people[.]
around my age traveling with us.[A][OpenMidRight]Yeah. I think I'm about the same
age as you are, too.[A]
You know what that means? That means,[.]
from now on, you're my rival.[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]What?[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]What do you say?[A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Um[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
Well, does that mean[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
I have to fight you?[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]No, no. It's nothing as complicated as
all that. We'll just work together.[.][A]
See, I'll try to be better than you,
and you try to be better than me![.][A]
Every day, try to be a better person
than you are today.[.][A]
It's easier to do when you've got[.]
someone to work with.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]I see[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
But why?[A][OpenMidRight]Yes, well.
Um[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
My brother's a knight, too, and he's
had someone like that for a long time.[A]
I've always been envious of the[.]
competitive relationship he has.[A]
They compete, and they argue, and[.]
they bicker[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
But I know they respect one another,
and they grow together.[.][A]
I envy that.[A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Um[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][.....]
I'm not sure I can be like that.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]Ha ha ha[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
Don't worry about it.[.][A]
It doesn't matter who you are.[A]
All that really matters is that we
have someone like that in our lives.[A]
Besides, you are a qualified soldier,[.]
are you not?[A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Er[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]I'm not honestly sure I'm[.]
even qualified to be out here.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]Same here.
That's why I picked you.[A]
Let's work together.[A][OpenMidLeft]All right![A]
I'm not sure I can live up
to your expectations[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
But I'll do my best.[A][OpenMidRight]Good. It's nice to
meet you, Amelia.[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]It certainly is![A][ToggleSmile]
[0C90]
[ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x106][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x119][OpenMidRight]Oh, Sir Franz![A][OpenMidLeft]Amelia, hello.
Call me Franz.[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]What? But[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]We are rivals, right? There's no
need for the formality of titles.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Oh, of course not, sir![.][A][OpenMidLeft]Ha ha ha[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
You did it again.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Well, then[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][.....]
I got it, Franz.[A][OpenMidLeft]Good.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Ha ha[.][ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]I'm not used
to being so casual.[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Can I ask you, what do
you think of this war?[A][ToggleSmile][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]What?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]I still don't understand why Grado
chose to invade Renais.[.][A]
Grado and Renais were allies. Their royal[.]
families were close friends.[A]
Why, Prince Ephraim and Princess Eirika[.]
are friends with your Prince Lyon.[A]
I detect something funny here.[A]
I simply cannot believe a friendship
so strong could end so abruptly.[A]
How many lives have been destroyed by[.]
such a seemingly random turn of events?[.][A]
Perhaps the prince and princess know
more of the truth, but[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]I[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]Oh, I'm sorry. I don't mean to
besmirch your homeland's name.[A][OpenMidRight]No, it's all right. I wonder what[.]
drives Grado's ambitions now, too.[A]
I was born in a rural village and[.]
raised in Grado's countryside.[A]
Ever since I was a little child,
I took pride in my home's origins.[A]
Grado, of course, is named after the
legendary hero who saved all of Magvel.[.][A]
I thought I lived in a country that[.]
believed in justice and peace.[A]
But this war[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]It's something
different than all that.[A][OpenMidLeft]Amelia[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
I'm sorry.[A]
This war must be especially[.]
painful for you[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I'll be fine, Franz.
But thank you, though.[A]
[ToggleSmile]It was wrong of Grado to invade[.]
Renais. Nothing can justify it.[.][A]
Grado has no right to destroy whole[.]
nations, ruin people's lives.[.][A]
This is all so[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]so wrong![.][A]
I began this war as a soldier[.]
in Grado's armies.[A]
But now[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
I just want to believe[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
I want to believe in justice! I want
to know I'm doing the right thing![A][OpenMidLeft]Amelia[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
I understand it all very well. Your[.]
love of your homeland[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
Your sense of justice, of honor[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
If there's anything I can do to[.]
help you, please let me know.[.][A]
[ToggleSmile]We are rivals, but that doesn't mean
we can't also be friends, right?[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]Franz[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][.....]
[ToggleSmile]Thank you.[A][ToggleSmile][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]I won't let you down.[.][A][OpenMidRight]No, neither will I![.][A]
[0C91]
[ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x106][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x119][OpenMidRight]Amelia.[.]
Can I ask you something?[A][OpenMidLeft]What is it?[.][A][OpenMidRight]Why did you become a soldier?[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Hm?[.][.....]
[ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidLeft][HalfCloseEyes][OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][.....]
Because I was alone.[A][OpenMidRight]Alone?[A][OpenMidLeft]When I was little, I lived in a[.]
remote village with my mother.[A]
One day[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]bandits raided our
village and took my mother.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Oh![.][A][OpenMidLeft]I had no father[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
My mother was my only family.[.][A]
She was so sick[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
and so very weak[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]When the bandits came[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
I hid under the bed[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseEyes][OpenMidLeft]I hid there[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]trembling[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]Amelia[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft][OpenEyes][OpenMidLeft][MoveMidLeft][OpenMidLeft]I wanted to protect her!
I[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]wanted to be strong![A]
[OpenMidLeft][HalfCloseEyes][OpenMidLeft]Even if I couldn't win[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
I wanted to fight![A]
To protect the only person
dear to me[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft][CloseEyes][OpenMidLeft]Oh[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
[ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
I see now[.][ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]Thank you for[.]
telling me your story.[A]
I want you to know this, Amelia.
[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]My parents are gone, too.[.][A][OpenMidLeft][HalfCloseEyes][OpenMidLeft]You[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]too[.][ToggleMouthMove]...?[ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes[.][ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]Well, I do have a brother, though.
But I don't remember my mother.[.][A]
But I swore that I would live my
every moment to its fullest.[A]
I swore to my parents that I would live 
a long life for them and be happy.[A]
Amelia[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]You're living the same way,[.]
embracing each passing moment.[A]
You believe in yourself, and your[.]
faith burns in you, making you shine.[.][A]
I don't know what it is you plan
to do with your life,[.][A]
but as long as we travel the same path,[.]
would you let me walk beside you?[.][A]
I have my own path to follow, I know,[.]
but[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
I believe we're both walking toward[.]
the same goal.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft][OpenEyes][OpenMidLeft]Franz[.][ToggleMouthMove]...?[ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]You don't like that?[A][ToggleSmile][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft][MoveMidLeft][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]No! That's not it.
I'm[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]very happy![.][A]
[ToggleSmile]Franz[.][ToggleMouthMove]...![ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]Amelia, I'll protect you.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Franz[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
Thank you[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
I'm really happy. But[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]I want
to protect you, too.[A]
I am a soldier of sorts as
well, you know.[.][A]
So[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]let me be your
shield to protect you[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]And I will be your sword and
fight for you. From now on.[.][A]
You're not alone anymore,[.]
Amelia.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Thank you, Franz.[.][A][CloseSpeechSlow][OpenMidLeft][MoveRight][.....][OpenRight][CloseEyes][.......]
[0C92]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x105][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x10E][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Sir Gilliam.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Well, if it isn't Garcia[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Your armor suits you. Must have taken[.]
a lot of training to fight in it, eh?[.][A]
And it probably takes a lot of
strength to wear, too.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]I don't want to brag, but[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
None of Frelia's knights can
match me for strength.[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Oh, is that so? You know, in my day,
they said I was without equal.[A]
Hm[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]What do you say, Garcia?
Let's arm-wrestle![A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]You mean[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]right now?[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Oh, why not! It won't[.]
take more than a minute.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
Very well. I accept your challenge.[.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Excellent! I'd expect no less[.]
from a true knight! Let's go.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight][MoveRight][OpenMidLeft]All right[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft][MoveLeft][OpenRight]Hah![A][OpenLeft]Ng![.][A][OpenRight][ClearFace][OpenLeft][ClearFace][.......][......][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x105][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x10E][OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]You beat me. Well, I've got[.]
to hand it to you, Garcia.[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Ha ha! Don't feel bad. You
almost had me for a minute there.[.][A]
I'm impressed![A][ToggleSmile]
[0C93]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x105][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x10E][OpenMidRight]Sir Gilliam.[A][OpenMidLeft]Yes, Garcia?[A][OpenMidRight]About that match the other day[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]What, you mean when we arm-wrestled?
[ToggleSmile]That was a GREAT match.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]Yes, well[.][ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]I've been thinking.[.][A]
Now, if I remember it correctly,
I was using my sword arm[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
But you're left-handed, aren't you?[.]
You were using your off hand.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Huh?[A]
Oh, well[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]I didn't want[.]
to say anything, but[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]I knew it![A]
All right! We have to have a
rematch using our OTHER hands![A][OpenMidLeft]Garcia, are you[.][ToggleMouthMove]--[ToggleMouthMove][A]
Fine, fine. I accept
your challenge. [A][OpenMidRight]Let's try this again![.][A][OpenMidRight][MoveRight][OpenMidLeft]Yes[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft][MoveLeft][OpenRight]Hah![A][OpenLeft]Hmmmmm[ToggleMouthMove]...![ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenRight][ClearFace][OpenLeft][ClearFace][.......][......][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x105][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x10E][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Hm[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]See, this[.]
time, you beat me.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]True, but it WAS your off hand
this time, and it was still close.[A]
Garcia, you really are amazing.[.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Ha ha ha![.][A]
You know, I feel good about this.[.]
I lost, but[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]I feel good.[A]
With a great knight like you at[.]
our side, we've nothing to fear.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Don't be silly, Garcia.[.]
You're an amazing fighter.[A]
With you in our midst, our
forces are invincible![A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Ha![.][A]
Let us fight together, then, and
watch our enemies fall like leaves![.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Gladly![.][A][ToggleSmile]

Oh, Gilliam[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]Sorry to bother you. You just seem
to have something on your mind.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]I do. I was[.][ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]I was just thinking[.]
about my son, Ross.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Ah, Ross. He's a good lad.[A][OpenMidLeft]It's[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]a wonderful feeling[.]
to have a son, Gilliam.[.][A]
[ToggleSmile]I was so happy to learn I had a boy[.]
who could follow in my footsteps.[.][A][Clear]
[ToggleSmile]Do you have children?[.][A][OpenMidRight]Oh, no[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]You know what the[.]
life of a soldier is like.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Aye, I remember it well. But I still
found a wife. Don't you have anyone?[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I[.][ToggleMouthMove]-- [.][ToggleMouthMove]Well, to be honest[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
There is someone I've had my eye on,
but what do soldiers know of love?[A]
I don't know how to win a woman's heart.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Ha ha ha ha ha![.][A]
Oh, don't take it too hard. These[.]
are tough times for romance.[A]
As time passes, the world will change.
No, WE will change it.[A]
Wait for your time. When the world changes,[.]
people change. Soldiers change. Just wait.[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]You're right.[.][A]
When this war ends, I'll be ready[.]
to face a different type of battle.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Yes.[A]
And when you do wed, you must be
sure to invite me and my boy.[.][A]
It will be a great celebration.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Yes, of course, my friend.[A]
[0C95]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x105][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x12B][OpenMidRight]Gilliam, long time, no see.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Syrene.[.][A]

[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]

Is there something on my face?[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Oh, it's nothing. Don't worry about it.[.][A]
You're still one of the best-looking men
in Frelia's army.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]You know I hate it when you tease me.[.][A]
What is that smile about?[.]
You're making me very nervous.[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]You were with me on my first mission
as one of Frelia's pegasus knight elite.[A]
Do you remember?[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Was I really? I hardly remember.[A]
I have a tough time picturing the[.]
famous Syrene as a green recruit.[.][A]
That really was a long time ago.[A][OpenMidRight]Oh, really? What do you[.]
mean by that?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Oh, nothing. Nothing.[.][A]
Just that you've always been
one of Frelia's finest warriors.[A][OpenMidRight]Gilliam[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
This mission matters more to me[.]
than that first mission did.[A][OpenMidLeft]I understand. Much more hangs[.]
in the balance if we fail.[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]We won't fail. I won't allow it![A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Don't be a hero.[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Thanks, Gilliam.[A]
I'm grateful that you're
here with me.[.][A][ToggleSmile]
[0C96]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x12B][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x105][OpenMidLeft]Gilliam, how are you doing?[.][A][OpenMidRight]Everything's fine for now, but[ToggleMouthMove]--[ToggleMouthMove][A]
Syrene?[.][.....]
You look pale. Are you feeling unwell?[A][OpenMidLeft]I'm fine, Gilliam.
Don't worry about me.[.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]Syrene.[.][A]
People come to you when[.]
they need advice, right?[A][OpenMidLeft]They do, yes. Why do you ask?[.][A]
Don't tell me you need
some advice from me.[A][OpenMidRight]Yeah. Can we talk?[A][OpenMidLeft]Oh[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]well[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
[ToggleSmile]Of course.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]People come to talk to me, too. Must
be[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]the wisdom of age or something.[.][A]
But I don't know what to say. What do[.]
you do if you have no advice to give?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]That happens all the time.
[ToggleSmile]But I've learned something[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
People feel better as soon as they let
it out. They just want you to listen.[.][A]
We're fighting a war. It's only natural[.]
that people get scared and need comfort.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]Do you[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]get scared?[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]Gilliam.[A]
Is this all just an attempt[.]
to probe me for my problems?[A][OpenMidRight]Oh, er, don't be[ToggleMouthMove]--[ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Don't worry.[A]
If I ever have any problems,
I'll be sure to come to you.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]I'm always here.[A][OpenMidLeft]Thanks, Gilliam.[A]
[0C97]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x12B][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x105][OpenMidLeft]Gilliam!
I'll be right there![A][OpenMidRight]Syrene![.]
Don't be a hero![A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]Gilliam, you're always
telling me to be careful[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
You know full well I watch over[.]
everyone. It's what I do.[.][A]
But you[.][ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]You're the one
who always watches over me.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]Syrene[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]You know why I stay close to
you? Just to hear you say that.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]Gilliam[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]Is that[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]all you want to[.]
hear me say?[A][OpenMidLeft]What do you[.][ToggleMouthMove]--?[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]Syrene[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][.....]
When this war is over[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][.....]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][.....]
Let's get married.[A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]Gilliam![A][OpenMidRight]Don't answer now.[.][A]
When this war is over[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
When we get back to Frelia[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
Wait until then, will you?
Wait until then to tell me.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Gilliam[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
You needn't wait that long.[.]
You already know my answer.[.][A]
[ToggleSmile][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]But if that is what[.]
you want, Gilliam, then yes![A]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]I will wait until the war is
over before I give my answer![.][A]
Gilliam[.][ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]Good luck.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]Syrene[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][.....]
Good luck to you.[.][A]
[0C98]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x107][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x105][OpenMidLeft]Gilliam, did you hear something?[A][OpenMidRight]No, Moulder. I didn't[.]
hear a thing.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Was it just in my head?[.]
Hm. That can't be good.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Moulder, you've been working yourself[.]
too hard. You should rest.[A][OpenMidLeft]No, I'm not tired in the slightest.[.]
I'm fine.[.][A]
I cannot believe you don't hear it![.]
Is something wrong with your ears?[A][OpenMidRight]Moulder, please.[A]
I know I've seen many battles,
but I'm younger than you are.[.][A]
My hearing is fine.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Then why can't you hear it? I'm[.]
starting to worry about that noise.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Your ears are playing tricks on you.[A]
[0C99]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x107][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x105][OpenMidLeft]There it was again! That sound I told[.]
you about. Gilliam, did you hear it?[A][OpenMidRight]Oh, not again. No, Moulder.[.]
I don't hear anything.[A][OpenMidLeft]Is it really just me? Am I the
only one who can hear it?[.][A][OpenMidRight]Maybe you should describe the[.]
sound to me.[A]
Is it a dull noise? A chirp? If it's
louder, I should be able to hear it.[A][OpenMidLeft]No, it's nothing like that. It's
soft[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]a melody of some sort.[A][OpenMidRight]A melody? Are you saying someone
is playing music during a battle?[.][A]
What kind of music? What sort[.]
of instrument is it?[A][OpenMidLeft]I can't explain it.[.]
It's so[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]heavenly.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Heavenly?[.][.....] You don't suppose
it's some sort of[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]sign, do you?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Gilliam, I would be happy if you
didn't say such things.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Oh, sorry. But, Moulder[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
You're the one dedicated to spiritual[.]
matters. I wouldn't be surprised if[.][ToggleMouthMove]--[ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]I said enough of that, Gilliam. I must
be imagining things. That's all.[A][OpenMidRight]A melody only you can hear.[.]
Sounds mysterious to me.[A][OpenMidLeft]I agree. Especially because I can't[.]
explain the cause. I must say, I'm worried.[.][A]
Gilliam[.][ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]If something were to[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
happen, well[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]I'm counting on you.[A][OpenMidRight]Moulder, we've been friends for a decade
and a half. I'll protect you.[.][A]
Besides[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]it's my duty as[.]
a Knight of Frelia.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]I know I can count on you, Gilliam.[.]
I know that better than any man.[A]
You have my gratitude.[A][OpenMidRight]Of course, Moulder.[.][A]
[0C9A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x107][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x105][OpenMidRight]How are your ears today, Moulder?[.]
Can you still hear that melody?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]No, I haven't heard it for a while.[.]
I guess it was a hallucination after all.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Regardless of the cause, I'm glad[.]
that you don't hear it anymore.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]I'm relieved, too, but[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]I also
miss it somewhat.[.][A]
The melody was haunting me, and[.]
I finally remember what it was.[.][A][OpenMidRight]And? What was the song?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]That was the music played 
at King Hayden's coronation. [.][A][OpenMidRight]Frelia's coronation hymn.[.][A][Clear]
[ToggleSmile]Ah, I remember it well[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
It is a strong song, and Frelia's[.]
knightly choir performed it well.[.][A][ToggleSmile][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]I was the one who carried[.]
the crown to the throne.[A]
I was so nervous that I[.]
might drop it![A][OpenMidRight]I remember that you were the one
to bear that regal burden.[A]
I was a mere recruit, stuck in
the back with the other whelps.[.][A]
You know, I remember now[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]Your
hands shook like you were frozen![.][A][OpenMidLeft]Yes, and then someone shouted, in a loud
voice, [OpenQuote]Get ahold of yourself, man![CloseQuote][A]
The crown slipped, and I fumbled to[.]
catch it! I was so embarrassed.[.][A][OpenMidRight]I'm so sorry.[.]
I was young.[A]
You know, I felt so bad that I have[.]
spent years making it up to you.[A]
I acted before I thought. I'm sorry[.]
for all the embarrassment I caused.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]That's right! I believe I met[.]
you the very next day.[A][Clear]
[ToggleSmile]Aha! I've figured it out![.][A][ToggleSmile][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]Figured what out?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]That melody[.][ToggleMouthMove]--[ToggleMouthMove]I could only hear it
when I was with you. That means[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]Yes?[A][OpenMidLeft]It was a sign. A sign from above that[.]
we must both return to the basics.[A][OpenMidRight]Return to the basics? What does[.][ToggleMouthMove]--[ToggleMouthMove]
[ToggleSmile]Ah. Of course.[A][ToggleSmile][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Yes. We must remember who we were and[.]
what drove us to join this cause.[.][A][OpenMidRight]I believe you are right[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[0C9B]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x105][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x10A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Gilliam[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][......]
Gilliam! Sir Gilliam![.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Be quiet, Neimi!
Someone will hear you![A][OpenMidRight]Oh[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]I'm sorry.[A]
I just wanted to tell you there's a[.]
scratch on the left side of your armor.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Oh, that's nothing. My armor's
covered in scratches.[.][A]
This one, I got defending Border
Mulan in a siege years back.[A]
And this one goes back to my very[.]
first fight as a knighted soldier.[A]
Each of these is a story.[.]
Each one is a mark of pride.[A][OpenMidRight]Yes, but I'm worried about this[.]
one near the glide clip.[A]
I can repair it. Just[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]don't[.]
go anywhere![A][OpenMidLeft]Neimi, don't go off by yourself!
We're in the middle of battle![A]
One false step, and our strategy could
be ruined[.][ToggleMouthMove]--[ToggleMouthMove]you might create an opening![A]
You put not only yourself but all of
us in peril when you do that![.][A][OpenMidRight][HalfCloseEyes][OpenMidRight]Oh! I didn't mean to[ToggleMouthMove]--[ToggleMouthMove]
[OpenMidRight][CloseEyes][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]Sniff[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]Don't cry, Neimi. Save
your energy for fighting.[.][A][OpenMidRight][OpenEyes][OpenMidRight]Y-yes, sir! I'm[.][ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]I'm sorry.[A][OpenMidLeft]Listen. This is my armor.[.]
I take good care of it myself.[A]
Don't worry about other people's
armor. Worry about yourself.[A]
Understood?[.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]Yes, you're right.[A]
I'm so sorry[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]Sorry[.]
for[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]for messing around.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]I[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]do appreciate your concern.[.][A]
If you see something, bring it
to my attention, and I'll fix it.[.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I will![.]
Thank you, Sir Gilliam![.][A][ToggleSmile]
[0C9C]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x10A][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x105][OpenMidRight]Neimi. You seem to be adjusting[.]
to the rigors of combat well.[.][A]
You're a skilled archer after all.[A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Oh[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]I'm so glad to hear you say that![.]
I was so sad after we talked last.[A]
I didn't know what to do, but then,[.]
I decided to focus on my archery.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]That's the spirit, Neimi. So, have
you been training by yourself?[A]
I never mastered archery. I'm[.]
sorry I can't help you train.[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]No, no[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]Thank you, but I've[.]
been thinking about this a lot.[.][A]
First, I need to sharpen my vision
so I can target more easily.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]Sharpen your vision?[A]
Good eyesight seems essential[.]
in a good archer, but[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
How can you improve your
vision? I don't understand.[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]My grandfather taught me to stare[.]
into the distance and concentrate.[A]
My grandfather taught me everything[.]
I know about the bow.[.][A]
My grandfather was[ToggleMouthMove]--[ToggleMouthMove]
He was a great archer.[A]
One time, a snake was attacking a bird [.]
nest on a tree in a mountain far away.[A]
He aimed at the snake and shot it down.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]Incredible. He was able to pick out[.]
and hit a snake from that distance?[.][A]
[ToggleSmile]Your grandfather must have been[.]
a great archer.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yes, he was. And that's why I've
been staring into the distance.[.][A]
I've been training constantly on the
field, and my vision has improved.[A]
See that tree in the distance? I can
spot the bugs crawling on its leaves.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]I'll be impressed when you can
hit each of those bugs from here.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]But[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]that would be cruel![A][OpenMidRight]There's no need to shoot bugs. You
only need to shoot our enemies[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[ToggleSmile][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]using your keen eyes and the
skills your grandfather gave you.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Don't you worry!
You can count on me![A][ToggleSmile]
[0C9D]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x105][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x10A][OpenMidLeft]Neimi, I wanted to ask about your[.]
vision-training regimen.[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Ah, where I stare into the
distance and concentrate?[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Yes. I've been trying it out
myself, but[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
I've had some problems.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Problems?[.]
What do you mean?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Whenever I'm training, people[.]
start to avoid me.[A]
It's not just that. Even animals
run away from me when I'm at it.[A][OpenMidRight]And you're just[.][ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]You're just[.]
staring into the distance?[A][OpenMidLeft]Yes. Standing perfectly still,
staring into the distance.[A][OpenMidRight]Maybe it's[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]because you look
scary[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
I used to get that a lot.[.][A]
Cormag said I was frightening him.
He thought I was angry at him.[A][OpenMidLeft]I look[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]scary? Hm[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
I have refined my stare to intimidate[.]
my foes in battle. You may have a point.[A]
No wonder people get scared when they[.]
see me glowering into the distance.[.][A]
You know, I might almost consider it
a compliment of my knightly prowess![A][OpenMidRight]I have an idea[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]Perhaps if you
[ToggleSmile]smile, it might not be so scary.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]Like this?[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]It's still scary, isn't it?[.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Uh[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]Maybe it's because you're[.]
crossing your arms.[.][A]
How about[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]holding some flowers
instead? That might help.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]You want me to stare into the distance[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
smiling[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]and holding flowers?[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I think that would look good[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]You're just being nice, Neimi.[A]
Your keen vision is a gift, and[.]
your training may improve it[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
But I know I can never imitate it.
It's yours and yours alone.[.][A]
[ToggleSmile]I place much faith in your
sharp eyes and your steady hand.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Th-thank you, Gilliam!
I won't let you down![.][A][ToggleSmile]
[0C9E]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x107][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x108][OpenMidLeft]Vanessa, how are you holding up?[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Father Moulder.[.][A]
We are struggling, but
I'll pull through somehow.[A]
[ToggleSmile]Say, Father Moulder[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]You want to know about Prince[.]
Innes, don't you? He's doing well.[A]
I was worried for a moment,[.]
but he'll be fine.[A][OpenMidRight]Oh![.][.....][A]
I, uh[.][ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]Thank you.
[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
How did you know?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Well[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
You see, as a priest, I've met
people from all walks of life.[A]
Some of them[ToggleMouthMove]--[ToggleMouthMove]like you[ToggleMouthMove]--[ToggleMouthMove]well, I[.]
can read them like an open book.[A][OpenMidRight]You[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]can read my mind?[.]
That's so[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]embarrassing.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]No, no. It's not like that. I just mean[.]
you are a pure, straightforward girl.[.][A]
That's a compliment worthy of a knight.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Do you think so?
Thank you, Father.[A][OpenMidLeft]Hm. Say, would you like to hear[.]
a story from the prince's youth?[A][OpenMidRight]I'd like that, Father. Very much![.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Hm[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][......]
[ToggleSmile]Oh my![A]
You know, I think we'd better[.]
take care of our enemies, first.[A][OpenMidRight]Look out![.][.....]
Over there![.][A]
Stay here, Father. I'll[.]
take care of this.[A][OpenMidLeft]Yes, I think that would be best.[A][OpenMidRight]Tell me your story another time,
though. I'd like to hear it.[A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I'd be delighted.[.]
Another time, then.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes, Father![A][ToggleSmile]
[0C9F]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x107][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x108][OpenMidLeft]Well, do you have time
for that story I promised?[A][OpenMidRight]Certainly, Father.[A][OpenMidLeft]It was over ten years ago, when[.]
the prince was just a child.[A]
There was a ceremony at the castle,[.]
with a trick archer of sorts.[.][A][OpenMidRight]A trick archer?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Yes. He was a very famous and undeniably
skilled archer from abroad.[.][A]
He was to shoot a tiny target that had
been placed in the distance.[A]
However, in the middle of the show,[.]
someone stopped him from shooting.[A][OpenMidRight]Oh, no[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]It wasn't[.][ToggleMouthMove]--[ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]Yes, it was young Prince Innes.[.][A]
He said, [OpenQuote]That's not far enough!
Move the target back farther![CloseQuote][A]
Then, he insisted on trying himself.[A][OpenMidRight]That's so like him![.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Isn't it?[.]
[ToggleSmile]King Hayden tried to stop him, but[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
Well, you know how he is.[.]
He doesn't listen to anyone.[A]
And so, it became a contest between our[.]
prince and this foreign archer.[.][A][OpenMidRight]So, what happened?[A][OpenMidLeft]First, they established the ground rules.[.][A]
Each person was to shoot at the target. If
both arrows hit, they increased the range.[A]
They simply continued to move the target
back until one person missed the mark.[A][OpenMidRight]Sounds simple enough.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Ah, but the two were evenly matched.
Every shot was a perfect bull's-eye.[A]
The crowd cheered, and the target[.]
moved ever farther back[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
But then it came to the turning point.
The foreign archer said, [.][A]
[OpenQuote]This is no test. Let's move the
target back more.[CloseQuote][A]
It seemed like bravado, but the archer
actually had a clever tactic in mind.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Clever? How so?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]They had been shooting for some time,[.]
and the archer's arms had grown weary.[A]
Precision archery is far more taxing
than the battlefield, you see.[A]
So even though he was a skilled archer,[.]
he was at the limits of his endurance.[A]
He was still hitting the mark accurately,[.]
but his arm was quivering more and more.[A]
Everyone knew that the prince was[.]
on the verge of victory.[A][OpenMidRight]I don't understand. They were shooting at[.]
the same target, shot for shot, right?[A]
Why would moving the target make any
difference?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Yes, they were still shooting at the
same target.[A]
However, the archer suggested that they[.]
move the target much farther away[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
Much farther than any child Innes's age[.]
could hope to loose an arrow to.[A][OpenMidRight]Oh, that IS clever![.][A][OpenMidLeft]Even the archer, with his trained arms,[.]
was firing at his maximum range.[A]
In fact, he almost missed the target![.][A]
Then, it was the prince's turn.[.][A][OpenMidRight]And[.][ToggleMouthMove]...?[ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]It was clearly too far away for the[.]
young prince to hit the target.[.][A]
But His Highness was undeterred. He drew
his string and fired up into the sky.[.][A]
The arrow did not merely hit the target.
No, it was a perfect bull's-eye![A]
You see, the prince arced his shot
to extend his range beyond its limits.[A]
To hit a target this way requires[.]
incredible skill, but the prince did it.[A]
And then he turned to the archer and said,
[OpenQuote]Shall we move the target back farther?[CloseQuote][A]
The archer looked so crestfallen. He
admitted defeat, and it was settled.[A][OpenMidRight]That's amazing[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]That it is.[.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Thank you very much, Father[.]
Moulder! That's incredible![.][A]
I'm even more[.][ToggleMouthMove]--[ToggleMouthMove][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]More[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]what?[.][A][OpenMidRight]Oh[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
No, nothing.[A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I'm glad you liked the story.[.][A]
Keep up the good work, Vanessa.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes, sir![.][A][ToggleSmile]
[0CA0]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x107][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x108][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I'm glad to see you well, Vanessa. You
do your fellow pegasus knights proud.[.][A]
We are blessed to have you fighting[.]
at our side.[A][ToggleSmile][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]You credit us warriors too much, Father.
Without healers, we would all be lost.[A]
Nothing I say can tell you how much[.]
I value your presence here.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]We are all doing our
part in this war.[.][A]
No need to thank me.[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I'm serious![A]
Without your help, we would[.]
never survive these skirmishes![.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]I'm gratified by that.
Thank you.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]Father[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]Thank you again[.]
for the other day.[A][OpenMidLeft]Hmm?[.....]
Oh, you mean that story?[A][OpenMidRight]Yes.[A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Ah[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
You know, you remind me of
myself, twenty years back.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]Huh?[A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Oh, never mind[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
Good luck to you, Vanessa.[A]
I don't know where this will lead, but
I'm sure the prince knows your feelings.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]Father Moulder, I only aspire to be[.]
worthy of his greatness.[A]
I expect nothing in return.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Are you sure?[.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]Well, do what you think is best for you.[A]
We all carry many burdens[.][ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]To country,[.]
family, duty, honor[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
However, we are all ultimately free[.]
to embrace or reject those burdens.[.][A]
[ToggleSmile]If you find yourself in need of[.]
spiritual guidance, speak to me.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]Father Moulder, you're so kind.[.][A]
[ToggleSmile]Thank you. I'm so grateful to[.]
have you on the field with me.[A][ToggleSmile][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Vanessa, we fight for the greater good.[.][A]
We fight for our country, for our[.]
friends, and[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]for ourselves.[A][OpenMidRight]You're right, Father.[.]
In so many things.[A]
[0CA1]
[ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x10C][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x107][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Colm, you dolt! Don't[.]
you see what you've done!?[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Hey! That's no way to be! I was[.]
trying to do you a favor here.[A]
It's not my fault if I accidentally[.]
burned your package lighting my torch![A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]That's exactly what I'm talking about![A]
You're always so careless! My spare[.]
robes were in that bundle![A]
Oh, and now look at them![.]
They've been charred black![.][A][ToggleSmile][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Oops[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][.....]
Those were your clothes?[A]
Tch! That IS a shame.[.]
My mistake. I apologize.[A][OpenMidRight]This isn't the first time this has
happened, Colm![.][A]
And it was my robes of office then, too![A]
I'm starting to wonder if you have
it in for my clothes![.][A][OpenMidLeft]Oh, no, no. Don't be silly![.][A]
And besides, only the bottom has been[.]
singed. Just trim it off and wear it short.[.][A]
[ToggleSmile]See? Why, I'm sure you'll set the world[.]
of fashion on fire with your new look![A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]That's what you said last time about
the sleeves.[A][OpenMidLeft]Oh, er[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]Really?[.]
[ToggleSmile]Ha ha ha![.][A]
[ToggleSmile]Well, sorry. I'm sorry. No,[.]
really. I deeply regret this.[.][A][OpenMidRight]You don't look particularly sorry.
You look rather pleased with yourself.[A][OpenMidLeft]No, I'm sorry! Truly![.]
[ToggleSmile]Seriously![A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]If that's the case, then you can just spend[.]
tonight reflecting upon what you've done.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Me? Are you kidding?[A][OpenMidRight]I want you to take some time to reflect[.]
on the consequences of your actions.[A]
Colm, I'm only doing this because I care.[.]
I care about the condition of your soul.[A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]You really know how to lay
on a guilt trip, don't you?[.][A][Clear]
Sigh. I'm in trouble now[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
Shoot![A]
[0CA2]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x107][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x10C][OpenMidLeft]Colm. Did you do what[.]
I asked of you?[.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Of course, Father Moulder![A]
In fact, I've set aside a little time[.]
each night to reflect on my day's deeds![A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Good. I'm glad to hear you've taken[.]
my suggestion to heart.[.][A]
Might I inquire as to what manner[.]
of thing you're reflecting on?[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Well, I reflected on how hungry I was, and
so I packed some extra salted pork today.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Did you say[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]salted pork?[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes. See, on reflection, it had been
a while since I'd had salted pork.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
What about the day before?[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Hm[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove] The day before[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][......]
Oh, yeah![.][A]
I was reflecting on how much walking we'd[.]
done, and I realized I needed new shoes.[A]
I figured, next chance I get, I'd go
out and steal me a new pair![A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Colm[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
I'm not sure you understand what
it is I asked you to reflect upon.[A][OpenMidRight]You told me to think about what I'd done
during the day and to reflect on it.[A][OpenMidLeft]I told you to think over the things 
you did and feel sorry for having done.[.][A]
I wasn't talking about what you wanted
to eat or whether you needed new shoes![.][A]
That is not the point of all this![A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Did it ever cross your mind that[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
maybe I haven't done anything I'm 
sorry about?[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Don't be foolish![.][A]
Think back on the things you've[.]
done during the day.[A]
Then, think about the troubles you
caused and vow not to repeat them![A]
Do you understand me now?[.]
This is for your own sake![A]
I'll come back in a few days.[.]
Keep thinking![A][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]I thought that whole self-reflection
thing was going a little too well.[A]
Fine, Father. I'll do it.[.]
I'll do it.[.][A]
[0CA3]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x10D][OpenMidLeft]Yawn[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][CloseSpeechSlow][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x107][......][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x10C][OpenMidLeft]Oh. Let me guess. You want to hear
what I've been reflecting on.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Exactly. Although[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]I noticed that
you look sleepy. Are you well?[A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]was up late last night thinking[.]
about everything. I couldn't sleep well.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]That's unfortunate. Did you have
so much that you regretted doing?[.][A]
Hm. Well, let me hear it.[.][A]
Tell me what's on your mind.[A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]All right, well, here goes.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][ClearFace][.......][......][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x10C][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x107][OpenMidRight]Hmmmmm[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
That's[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]How's that? I'm doing[.]
good, aren't I?[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]I'd say so. You're going over your
every action, from waking to sleep.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Well, that's what 
you told me to do.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]Well done, my lad![A]
I've never heard so much thought
go into what you've done before![A]
Compared with the salted pork,
your transformation is impressive![A]
It's a little extreme, but[ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]But the funny thing is[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
I've started noticing all these[.]
things about me I didn't know before.[.][A]
I keep saying, [OpenQuote]That was wrong[CloseQuote] and[.]
[OpenQuote]I'll do better next time.[CloseQuote][.][A]
So[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]I'm not repeating the[.]
same mistakes over and over.[A][OpenMidRight]I had noticed that your behavior
has significantly improved of late.[.][A]
You look sleepy now, but your face
seems far more peaceful as well.[A]
It seems that you're finally growing
up, thanks to these quiet moments.[A][OpenMidLeft]Heh[.][ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]You know, I think that's the
first nice thing you've said to me![.][A][OpenMidRight]You're coming along just fine. But[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
go easy on yourself, all right?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]How come?[.][A][OpenMidRight]If you stay up all night thinking about[.]
your day, you'll make yourself sick.[A]
You've already mastered the art of
learning from your own experiences.[.][A]
I don't want you falling into old[.]
habits because of a little illness.[.][A]
I have high expectations of you,
my son.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Thank you, Father Moulder. I'm
glad that you do.[.][A]
It's only your expectations that
have made me become a better man.[.][A]
[0CA4]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x107][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x12B][OpenMidRight]Father Moulder, you look tired.[.][A]
We've been asking so much[.]
of you lately[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]Don't worry about me.[.][A]
I'm rather more worried 
about you, Syrene.[A]
You had only just been transferred
to this unit when we left Frelia.[.][A]
I'd imagine it must be odd not
having any familiar faces around.[.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I've already learned everyone's[.]
name and field of specialization.[.][A]
Don't worry about me.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Impressive. You've been[.]
paying attention.[.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]To beat your enemy, know your allies.[.][A]
Without knowing the skills of your
own men, you can never win a war.[.][A]
I don't want to die just because I didn't[.]
know what to expect from my troops.[.][A][ToggleSmile][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]I was worried about how well you
were integrating into our group.[A]
You seem to have matters well in hand,
though. I'm proud of you, Syrene.[.][A]
If you have any questions, [.]
don't hesitate to ask me anytime.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Thank you, Father Moulder. I do[.]
appreciate your thoughtfulness.[.][A]
[0CA5]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x12B][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x107][OpenMidRight]Syrene, you said you'd already learned
everything about our little band.[.][A]
Did anyone in Frelia go over the details
with you before you left?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]No, Father. Things were rather hectic in
Frelia before we left, as you know.[.][A]
[ToggleSmile]Everything I have learned, I've[.]
learned on the job, so to speak.[A]
People[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]confide in me, and I
learn by observation.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]Interesting. So, even though you're new,
they know they can confide in you?[A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yes. The ladies seem most[.]
comfortable speaking to me.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]I understand. Even a man of the cloth[.]
is still, at heart, a man.[A]
It must reassure them to know that there
is another woman to whom they can speak.[A]
[ToggleSmile]There are many women among us.[A]
If I cannot be [OpenQuote]father[CloseQuote] to them, please,
care for them as a mother.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]With all respect, Father, I refuse to[.]
minister to their needs as a mother would.[A]
I am still young and unworthy. I prefer[.]
to speak to them as a sister.[.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Ha ha ha ha[.][ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]Yes, of course.[.]
Please excuse me.[.][A]
Help them, then, as a sister would.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yes, Father! Now, may I have a
word with you? As their sister?[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]I beg your pardon? [.][.....]Me?[.][.....] What?[A]
Has someone[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]complained about me?[A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Well, I'll let you know the[.]
day after next new moon.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]Must I wait until then?[.][A]
Is it so terrible that I needs
must prepare myself for the news?[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Rest easy, Father! It's only
a suggestion, not criticism.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]Hm[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]What could it be?[.][A]
[0CA6]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x107][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x12B][OpenMidLeft]So[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]Last night was a new moon.
And that means today is the day.[A]
I've been going mad wondering,
Syrene. What is your suggestion?[A][OpenMidRight]Ah, right you are, Father. It is
indeed the promised day.[A]
Well, then. On behalf of everyone,
I have two words for you.[.][A]
Father Moulder?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Y-yes[.][ToggleMouthMove]...?[ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Happy Birthday![.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]What? Birthday?[.][A]
Oh[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]Oh, yes! Why, today is
my birthday, isn't it? But[ToggleMouthMove]--[ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]It is a fine tradition to celebrate[.]
one's birthday, Father.[.][A]
In a war, uncertainty surrounds us
every moment of every day.[A]
Instead of worrying about tomorrow,[.]
let us celebrate life today.[A]
That should encourage us all to[.]
keep going, wouldn't you say?[.][A][ToggleSmile][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Yes, indeed. To share the joys of life
is very important.[A]
Thank you, Syrene. In this chaos, I[.]
would have forgotten my own birthday.[.][A][OpenMidRight]You exhaust yourself caring for others,[.]
but you pay no attention to yourself.[.][A]
We are all so grateful to you, Father.[A]
So many different people came up to me
to ask how we could show that gratitude.[A]
You are a man of great virtue, and
an inspiration to us all.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]I am touched[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
At my age, I thought all my happy[.]
birthdays were well behind me.[A]
I'm a little embarrassed at that[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]You must remember to take care of[.]
yourself, Father. And thank you.[A]
[0CA7]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x12B][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x108][OpenMidRight]Captain Syrene![.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Vanessa! How are you?[.]
I was worried about you![A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]I'm fine, ma'am. Thank you for your concern.
Glad to see you doing well too.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Vanessa, you know you don't need to 
talk like that when we're alone.[A][OpenMidRight]But we ARE on duty.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Let me put it this way, then.[.][A]
This is an order from your captain![.][A]
When we're alone, you are to speak to me [.]
as if we are at home.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Yes, ma'am![.][A][OpenMidLeft]Vanessa. Sigh.
Did you listen to a word I said?[A][OpenMidRight]Y-yes.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Ha ha ha! Yes, that's it![.][A]
Oh, by the way, I have something for you.[.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]What is it?[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Here you go.[A]
Father wanted me to give it to you.[.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]But this is[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
The war god Fale's amulet![A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yes, this is a battle amulet.[.]
I received one before I left home, too.[.][A]
You were summoned so suddenly that Father[.]
didn't get a chance to give it to you.[A]
And Mother wanted to tell you,
[OpenQuote]Never be apart from this amulet.[CloseQuote][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]But[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]She also wanted you to relax and do 
your best.[A]
And to get a good night's sleep always.[.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Well, I do try.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Maybe others don't notice, [.]
but I know you too well, Vanessa.[.][A]
I know you don't get enough rest when[.]
you feel overwhelmed with responsibility.[.][A]
But, to be at your best, you need to take 
care of yourself, OK?[.][A][OpenMidRight]Yes, ma'am[ToggleMouthMove]--[ToggleMouthMove]I mean, Sis.[A][OpenMidLeft]I'll be right by your side tonight,[.]
so just relax.[A]
You need a good night's sleep.[A][OpenMidRight]Thanks, Sis. I sleep better when [.]
you're around.[A]
[0CA8]
[ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x12B][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x108][OpenMidRight]Captain[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][.....]
[ToggleSmile]I mean, Sis.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]You look better, Vanessa.[.]
Did you sleep well?[.][A][OpenMidRight]Yes. First time in a long time.[.]
Thank you, Sis.[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I've been meaning to ask you[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][ToggleSmile][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]Yes?[A][OpenMidLeft]You don't seem to have much 
appetite lately.[A][OpenMidRight]Well, I've just been[ToggleMouthMove]--[ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]I told you, Vanessa, I know you too well.[.][A]
So, who's the lucky guy?[A][OpenMidRight]What?! That's just crazy![.]
I don't know what you're talking about![.][A][OpenMidLeft]You know I can tell when you're lying.
Plus, you not eating is a dead giveaway.[A]
I mean, when's the last time you said no
to a cookie? It's not a criticism.[A]
One of your most charming qualities is [.]
how you can outeat anyone.[A]
It's because of someone special, isn't it?[A][OpenMidRight]Well, um[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]But, Vanessa, first and foremost,[.]
you have to take care of yourself.[A]
I'll support you no matter what, but [.]
no one is worth losing your health over.[A][OpenMidRight]Thank you, I guess. I'll do my best[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
Sometimes I think that if I were more 
like you[ToggleMouthMove]--[ToggleMouthMove]you know, a great knight,[.][A]
an attractive woman, and just 
all-around perfect[ToggleMouthMove]--[ToggleMouthMove][A]
I'd have a better chance with him.
[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
Hmmm. That didn't sound as pathetic 
in my head as it did out loud.[A][OpenMidLeft]Don't be silly, Vanessa.
You may not know it,[A]
but I'm sure that person likes you for
who you are.[A][OpenMidRight]Do you really think so?[.][A]
I've always wanted to be like you.
You've always been my role model.[.][A]
But, I feel like whenever I finally[.]
catch up to you, you're already gone.[.][A]
You've already moved on.[A]
I'll never catch up with you, 
no matter how hard I try.[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I'm very proud of you, Vanessa.[.][A]
And as your older sister, I recognize 
your talent more than anyone else.[A]
You should be more confident.[.][A][ToggleSmile][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]I feel better after opening up to you.[A]
It's hard not to compare myself with you,[.]
but I have to get past that.[A][OpenMidLeft]That's the spirit. And remember, [.]
you have to take care of yourself.[A][OpenMidRight]Yes, I know.
As always, thanks, Syrene.[A]
[0CA9]
[ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x108][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x12B][OpenMidLeft]Hi, Syrene.[.]
Thanks for talking the other day.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Are you feeling better now?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Well[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]It's not that easy, but[.]
I quit comparing myself with you.[.][A][OpenMidRight]You might not know this, but there's
something about you I've always envied.[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]About me?[.][.....]
What do you mean?[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]You have an inner fortitude that [.]
I will never be able to match.[A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Inner[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]fortitude?[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]Do you remember when Father collapsed?[A]
Mother and I were so panicked that [.]
we didn't know what to do.[A]
You were the youngest of us all,[A]
but you gathered nuts in your small hands[.]
and went to the village to sell them.[.][A]
Then you came home with medicine for him.[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Well, I don't know what to say.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]When you face a difficult circumstance,[.]
your true self emerges.[.][A]
You were very young, but had the presence[.]
of mind and ingenuity to help Father.[.][A]
You comforted me and Mother, and you
rescued Father.[.][A]
I've always respected your strength,
and wished for some of it myself.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]But[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]you were the one who joined 
the Knights at such an early age,[.][A]
and it was you who supported our family.[A][OpenMidRight]I emulated your strength. 
I wanted to support my family like you did.[.][A]
It's always been my goal. And I respect 
you more than anyone else.[A]
I wish you could be as confident in yourself
as I am of you.[.][A]
No matter what, you'll always be all right.[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]All right, then. I have to tell you!
The person I love is[ToggleMouthMove]--[ToggleMouthMove][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Wait, Vanessa!
Wait until the war is over to tell me.[A]
When everything is over, bring him home.[A]
[ToggleSmile]I'll go home a little ahead of you, and 
wait for you two with Father and Mother.[A]
We'll make your favorite meal[.][ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]
Is that enough to convince you?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Yes.[A]
I'll do my best[.][ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]
For this war and also for him.[A][OpenMidRight]That's my girl. Don't worry.
You'll be all right.[A]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x108][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x110][OpenMidRight]Pegasus![A][OpenMidLeft]You must be [ToggleSmile]Lute![.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]And who are you?[A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I'm Vanessa.
I'm captain of Frelia's pegasus knights.[A]
And this here is Titania. We're both [.]
pleased to meet you, Lute.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]Ah, the pegasus, the proud, winged horse.[.][A]
You know, they only attach to someone they
accept as their master.[.][A]
And did you know that pegasi fly by kicking[.]
the air, not by flapping their wings.[.][A]
It's a common misconception, but wings
are mainly used for gliding.[A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]Yes, as captain, I learned all
this long ago. [.][A]
Plus, if they flapped their wings constantly,[.]
no one would be able to ride them.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]In some countries, the word pegasus 
means [OpenQuote]fountain[CloseQuote] or [OpenQuote]ocean.[CloseQuote][A]
Different cultures have different stories[.]
about the creation of the pegasus.[A]
In one legend, there was a monster who
could turn anyone into stone.[.][A]
When the monster died, its blood seeped into
the ground. There, a pegasus was born. [.][A][OpenMidLeft]Interesting[.][ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]You are very knowledgeable.[.][A][OpenMidRight]I know.[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]Well! Thank you for the lesson. 
I'm glad we're on the same team.[A]
It was nice meeting you.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]Yes, nice to meet you, Titania.[.][A][OpenMidLeft][MoveMidLeft][OpenMidLeft]I'm Vanessa![A]
[0CAB]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x108][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x110][OpenMidRight]Titania.[A][OpenMidLeft]Um[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]No.[.][A][OpenMidRight]I meant[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]Vanessa, right?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]I'm happy to know that I've made such a 
strong impression on you, Lute. [A]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][.....] So, what can I do for you?[.][A][OpenMidRight]It's common knowledge that pegasi have
strong resistance to magic.[.][A]
I developed a new counterattack to that 
power, but it still needs refining.[.][A]
I guess what I'm saying is[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][.....]
Can I try it out on Titania?[A][OpenMidLeft]What?![A]
[OpenMidLeft][MoveMidLeft][OpenMidLeft]No! Of course not![A][OpenMidRight]I was joking.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Sigh. You said it with such[.]
a straight face[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
You definitely had me fooled.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Thank you! That's so sweet of you to say.[.][A][OpenMidLeft][MoveMidLeft][OpenMidLeft]It wasn't a compliment![.][A]
Besides, you really don't seem like someone[.]
who has much of a sense of humor.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Is that right?[A][OpenMidLeft]Yes[.][ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]And it seems like your magic [.]
is the real thing.[A]
When you defeated the enemy the other day,
I saw a sharp flash of magic from above.[A][OpenMidRight]Gee, I wonder why that happened[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]Because[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]you're good?[A][OpenMidRight]Why, yes! You are 100 percent[.]
correct! For once.[A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]My point is, we don't have enough mages 
in Frelia, so we're counting on you.[A]
When I was growing up, I always wanted
to be a pegasus knight like my sister.[A]
I was also interested in magic, but[.]
I just didn't have the talent.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]Well, you are a great pegasus knight, 
so it's worked out fine.[A]
Besides, I am also interested in [.]
becoming a pegasus knight.[A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Where are you in your training?[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]I'm at 98 levels out of 158 levels total.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]That's very impressive[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[ToggleSmile]Anyway, let's just do our[.]
best out there, shall we?[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]Of course.[A]
[0CAC]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x108][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x110][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Lute, did you know this?[A]
The wings of a thousand pegasi are
an incredibly potent aphrodisiac.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight][MoveMidRight][OpenMidRight]I[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]I didn't know that[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][.....]
OK, now I really need Titania's help.[.][A][OpenMidRight][MoveLeft][OpenMidLeft][MoveMidLeft][OpenMidLeft][MoveFarLeft][OpenFarLeft]Wait! Wait! I was just kidding![.]
Hush, Titania! Hush! I was joking![A][OpenLeft][MoveMidRight][OpenMidRight]I see[.][ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]I was, um, kidding, as well.
Heh heh?[A][OpenFarLeft][MoveMidLeft][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Hee hee! Consider it payback.[.][A]
[ToggleSmile]But, Lute, I never thought you would [.]
try to steal the wings right off her back![A]
Guess the battlefield is a lonely place!
Ha ha ha ha![A]
You know, I'm often told that I need to[.]
loosen up and not be so serious.[A]
I'd always tried to be like my sister.[A]
She's very strong, as both a knight and 
a person. Maybe I've tried too hard.[A]
But it's so much easier to loosen up [.]
with people like you around. Thanks![A][OpenMidRight]I see.[A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]When I'm with you, I can
relax and just be myself.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]Oh, I'm so sorry to hear that.[A][OpenMidLeft][MoveMidLeft][OpenMidLeft]That was a compliment!
Jeez. You're a tough one[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[ToggleSmile]When this war is over, would you like 
to come visit me in Frelia?[.][A]
You could ride a pegasus if you'd like.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]That would be an illuminating experience.[.][A]
But I have to start reading up on pegasi
behavior now, so I won't get thrown off.[A]
Do they like carrots?[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Well, I don't know about that.
I'll let you do your research.[A]
I must go now. See you later, Lute.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]Yes, Vanessa.[.][A]

[OpenFarFarLeft][LoadFace][0x116][OpenFarFarLeft][CloseEyes][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x108][.....][OpenMidRight]What's that down there?! [.][.....]
Whoa, Titania! Whoa, girl! Let's stop here![.][A][CloseSpeechSlow][OpenMidRight][MoveFarFarRight][OpenFarFarLeft][MoveMidLeft][.......][OpenFarFarRight][MoveMidRight][OpenMidRight]Are you hurt?! Are you all right?![A][OpenMidLeft]Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]Huh?[A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]You have GOT to be kidding me!
Sleeping while a war is waging? [A]
Bold warrior, it's time to wake up![.][.....]
Hey! Lazybones! Get up![.][A][OpenMidLeft]Snargleblagh[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]hmph? Zzzzzzzzz[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft][HalfCloseEyes][OpenMidRight]Oh, boy[.][ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]Let's go, Titania.[A]
It's clear that Mr. Slug here needs his[.]
beauty rest.[A][OpenMidRight][ClearFace][......][OpenMidLeft][OpenEyes][OpenMidLeft][0x0080][ToggleSmile][.......][OpenMidLeft]Zzzzz[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove] Huh?[.]
Did someone say something?[A]
[0CAE]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x116][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x108][OpenMidRight]Oh, look who's actually awake today.[A][OpenMidLeft]You must be one of Frelia's pegasus 
knights.[A][OpenMidRight]I'm Vanessa.[A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yeah, that's right. Vanessa.
I'm Forde. Nice to meet you.[A]
By the way, what do you mean by me
being awake?[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]Just the other day, I was flying by 
and saw you lying on the ground.[A]
I thought you were hurt, but when I got 
closer, I saw that you were just sleeping![A]
I couldn't believe my eyes. I was so [.]
disgusted that I just left you there.[.][A]
But then I started to worry about enemies[.]
spotting you, so I went back.[.][A]
By the time I got back to where you were, 
you were already gone.[A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I catch them off guard that way and 
then attack. That's my strategy.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]I seriously doubt that.[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Ha ha ha![.]
But anyway, thanks for your concern.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]You really don't stress or plan much, do you?[.]
So different from our prince[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]The prince of Frelia? 
Ah, you mean Prince Innes.[A]
I think he's almost 100 percent stress.[.]
But I'm sure he's quite the ladies' man.[A]
I bet you have a crush on him, too.[.][A]
[ToggleSmile]You're blushing, so I must have hit 
a nerve![A][OpenMidRight]I-I don't! I didn't say anything![.][A][OpenMidLeft]A romance between a prince and his knight?
What scandal! What intrigue![A]
[ToggleSmile]It's all right, though. 
You can love anyone you like.[.][A]
You must have lots of competition,
seeing how he is a prince.[A]
It's much easier to date someone you can
be yourself around.[.][A]
Someone like, say, me would be ideal for you.[.]
What do you say?[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]Um[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
Let's go, Titania.
We've wasted enough time here.[A][OpenMidRight][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]You don't have to run away like that![.][.....]
OK, see you! Watch out for those archers![.][A][ToggleSmile]
[0CAF]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x108][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x116][OpenMidLeft]I think I misunderstood you.[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yeah? So you understand me now?[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]I guess so.[.][A]
You've been working for me from 
behind-the-scenes, haven't you.[.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes. But don't worry. I'm used to[.]
that sort of misunderstanding.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Well[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]thank you.[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Heh heh heh. You're welcome, of course.[.][A]
So, how about all that other stuff?[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]What do you mean?[.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Am I too far a cry from a prince?[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Um[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]I felt an energy[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]Energy? What are you talking about?[.][A][OpenMidRight]Everyone has a different type of energy.[A]
Some energies can heal hearts, others 
spread courage.[.][A]
[ToggleSmile]When you first saw me sleeping, 
I was dreaming of running across a field.[.][A]
I felt this warm energy engulfing me,[.]
blowing across my face like a summer wind.[A]
It must have been your energy that made me
feel that way.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]My[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]energy?[.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Would you like to feel my energy, too?[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Um[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
I'll certainly think about it.[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Wonderful! [.]
I'll be waiting for your answer, Vanessa.[.][A][ToggleSmile]
[0CB0]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x10F][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x108][OpenMidLeft]Vanessa, are you all right?[.][A][OpenMidRight][MoveMidRight][OpenMidRight]Prince Innes![.]
Yes, I'm fine. I'm glad YOU are fine, sir.[A][OpenMidLeft]Good, Vanessa.[A]
Your contributions to this war and also to
Frelia as a whole have been very valuable.[A][OpenMidRight]Thank you for your kind words, sir.[.][A]
I was so worried when a messenger from [.]
Carcino told us you were in danger.[.][A]
I worried for your safety.[A][OpenMidLeft]Nothing is going to happen to me.[.][A]
It's still very strange to me that
you are grown up and worry about me now.[A]
When you first joined the knights, [.]
you were just a girl.[.][A]
You've really grown, Vanessa.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Well, um[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]I'm still learning.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]You are a great knight now.[.]
[ToggleSmile]I'm counting on you, Vanessa.[.][A][ToggleSmile][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]Yes. I'll protect you at any cost.[A][OpenMidLeft]Ha ha ha![.]
Vanessa, you don't need to protect me.[A]
It's the other way around. As the prince
of Frelia, I have the duty to protect you.[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Oh, yes! I didn't mean to offend![.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Pshaw! [.]
But remember, I am counting on you.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Thank you, Prince![A]
[0CB1]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x10F][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x108][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Your skills are so polished now!
I bet you could shoot down a drop of rain![A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]You flatter me, Vanessa, but my skills [.]
aren't quite there yet.[.][A]
But I've noticed that you have improved 
quite a bit since this war started.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Oh! Thank you, sir.[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]You make me confident in battle.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]Me?![.....]
Oh[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]Er[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yes, you! 
With such a skilled knight at my side,[A]
I feel secure and can be my best in battle.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]Oh[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]Besides[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]Yes?[A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I can always sense you trying to [.]
protect me at any cost.[.][A]
Normally, I don't need any help, [.]
but you are the exception.[A]
I'm grateful for your help.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]Thank you very much!
It is my duty to protect you at any cost![.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Ha ha ha. Your duty, huh. 
That's fine, Vanessa.[.][A]
No need to worry about risking your life.[.]
I'm pretty unstoppable with you beside me.[A][OpenMidRight]You'll have to use a spatula
to peel me off your side![.][A]
[0CB2]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x10F][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x108][OpenMidLeft]What's wrong? You're spacing out.[.][A][OpenMidRight][MoveMidRight][OpenMidRight]I'm sorry, Prince Innes![A]
Watching you shoot that arrow[.]
reminded me of something.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]What's that?[A][OpenMidRight]The time you demonstrated your archery [.]
skills at the king's birthday ceremony.[.][A]
You shot three arrows simultaneously, and[.]
hit three different targets[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
I was so impressed. I still remember that[.]
moment like it was yesterday.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Well, even though there were three targets,[.]
they were only about an arm length apart.[.][A]
It wasn't like shooting three enemies in
battle.[.][A]
It's only an exhibition trick.[A][OpenMidRight]Even so, you couldn't have done it without
strong accuracy and concentration.[A]
It made a very strong impression on me[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
I've admired your skills ever since then.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Vanessa[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][.....]
Was it my skills you were admiring[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
or was it me?[.][A][OpenMidRight]What?![.....]
Um[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]Just kidding[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]Kind of.[A]
[ToggleSmile]But I'm impressed you remembered it.
I had forgotten until just now. [A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]I have[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]always been watching you[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
and always been admiring you[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
I hope that doesn't sound too creepy.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]I don't know what to say[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][.....]
I've always known you as a knight.[A]
A great knight, in fact. [.]
But when this war is over,[A]
I would like to get to know the other[.]
side of you. The woman.[.][A]
[ToggleSmile][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]Ahem. Yes. Let's go, Vanessa.[.]
Don't ever leave my side from now on![.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]Don't worry, Prince Innes![.....]
[ToggleSmile]I would follow you anywhere![A][ToggleSmile]
[0CB3]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x109][OpenMidLeft]Hmm[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x10E][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Ross.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Oh! Hi, Dad.[A][OpenMidRight]What are you thinking about?[A][OpenMidLeft]Nothing[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
Well, maybe just[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
What was Mom like?[A][OpenMidRight]Your mother[.][ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]Well[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
Where do I start?[.][A]
In many ways, she was very
similar to Princess Eirika.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Princess Eirika?[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes. She was gentle, but also very
strong. She could share others' pain.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]I see.[A][OpenMidRight]What's wrong? Do you miss her?[A][OpenMidLeft]I was just thinking[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
When was the last time we 
visited her grave?[A]
Not since we left the village[.]
and started this journey[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
It's been so long. She must[.]
be lonely[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]Ross[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]When the bandits attacked[.]
the village, we had to leave.[.][A]
But Mom's grave is still there.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Yes.[A][OpenMidLeft]Dad[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]Ross.[.]
Let's go home when the war is over.[.][A]
To the village where Risa rests.[A][OpenMidLeft]Dad[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]We can rebuild the village again,[.]
just the two of us.[.][A]
After all, that's where we belong[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
You, me, and[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]your mother.[A][ToggleSmile][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Yes![A]
[OpenMidLeft][MoveMidLeft][OpenMidLeft]All right. But I'll have to be a
lot stronger to help with that.[.][A]
[OpenMidLeft][MoveLeft][OpenLeft]So we'd better start training, Dad![.][A][OpenMidRight]If you insist. Show me
what you've got![A]
[0CB4]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x10E][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x109][OpenMidLeft]Eeeyeeergh![.][A][OpenMidLeft][MoveRight][OpenMidRight]That all you got?[.][A][OpenRight][MoveLeft][OpenLeft]Awww![.][......]
Mmmmgrrrr[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove] Ha![A][OpenLeft][MoveRight][OpenMidRight][MoveFarRight][OpenFarRight]Gah![......]
Ha![.][A][OpenFarRight][MoveMidRight][OpenRight][MoveMidLeft][OpenMidLeft]Gah[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][......]
Wahhhhhh!![A][OpenMidLeft][MoveRight][OpenMidRight][MoveFarRight][OpenFarRight]Hm?![......]
Haaaah![.][A][OpenFarRight][MoveMidRight][OpenRight]Whoa![.][A][CloseSpeechSlow][OpenRight][0x0080][LoadFace][0x007][OpenMidRight]All right[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][.....]
Good. That's it for today.[A][OpenFarFarLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x109][OpenMidLeft]Whew! Wow![A][OpenMidRight]Whew.[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]You're so strong, Dad.[A][ToggleSmile][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]Ha ha ha! You're finally getting the [.]
hang of it, boy![A]
Your stroke is heavier, and your swing
has definitely improved.[A][OpenMidLeft]Yes.[A]
I've been practicing all the time,
even when I'm not in battle.[A]
Maybe someday, I'll even surpass you![.][A][OpenMidRight]You're getting stronger, no doubt about it.[.]
But I'm not going to LET you win.[.][A]
You'll have to get there yourself.[A][OpenMidLeft]Now you're talking! The higher the hurdle,
the bigger the reward.[A]
All right, I'm gonna go practice my[.]
swing! See you later, Dad![A][OpenMidRight]All right, boy.[.][A]
[Clear][OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidRight]Risa, you'd be so happy. Ross has[.]
grown into a strong young man.[A]
[0CB5]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x109][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x10E][OpenMidRight]Ross.[.][A][OpenMidRight][MoveRight][OpenMidLeft]What is it, Dad?![.]
Ow[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]Ow! Ow! What are you doing?[.][A]
That hurts! You're crushing my shoulder![A][OpenRight]Ross[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]What's wrong, Dad?[A][OpenRight]Ross[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]I'm going to be sentimental[.]
for a moment. Bear with me.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Huh?[A][OpenRight]You may be almost grown, but you're[.]
all I've got in this world.[.][A]
It's true that your skills have[.]
improved, but don't act foolishly.[A][OpenMidLeft]Huh?[A][OpenRight]There's no greater tragedy than when
a parent must bury his child.[.][A]
Do you see where I'm going with this?[.][A][.......][OpenMidLeft]Yes[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]I understand. It's just weird[.]
to hear you talking like this[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
I guess I have been getting a big head. 
No one is invincible.[.][A][OpenRight]Yes, that's right.[A]
And when you start to think you are,
that's when you're the most vulnerable.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]I was just all puffed up when you said
I had improved. I'll be careful from now on.[A]
[ToggleSmile]I haven't told this to anyone,
but I guess dads can see these things.[A][ToggleSmile][ToggleSmile][OpenRight][ToggleSmile]No matter how old you get, you'll 
always be my son.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Yes, and I'll always look up to you![A]
[0CB6]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x123][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x10E][OpenMidRight]You must be Dozla.[A][OpenMidLeft]That's right! Who are you?[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]My name is Garcia. Sir Dozla, I've [.]
been hearing a lot about you lately. [.][A][OpenMidLeft][MoveMidLeft][OpenMidLeft]Only good things, I hope! Ha ha ha![.]
I've heard of you, too, Sir Garcia.[.][A]
Mostly about your incredible strength!
Hey, would you mind lifting this boulder?[.][A]
Just kidding! Ha ha ha![.][A][OpenMidRight]Ha ha. It's not a big deal.[.]
Are you normally this[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]energetic?[A][OpenMidLeft]Well, I stuffed myself, so [.]
I'm feeling pretty great![.][A][OpenMidRight]You can't fight on an empty stomach.[A]
Eating is very important to keep up 
your strength. Especially breakfast.[A]
I've heard that in some cultures, they call[.]
breakfast [OpenQuote]first break.[CloseQuote][A][OpenMidLeft]What's that? What do they break?[A][OpenMidRight]A fast.[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]A fast what? Huh? Speak plainly! I don't
understand all this talking in circles.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]We don't eat anything while we sleep,[.]
so it's as if we are fasting.[.][A]
So, the meal you eat in the morning[.]
breaks that fast.[.][A]
This means that breakfast is an 
especially important meal.[A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Huh. Who would have thunk it?[.][A]
[ToggleSmile]The only thing I consumed this
morning was knowledge![A][OpenMidRight]What do you mean?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Just that I make it a point[.]
to learn other disciplines.[.][A]
You have to if you want to
grow as a fighter.[A][OpenMidRight]I completely agree.[.][A]
Young men in this army are strong in [.]
their specific fields, but weak in others.[A]
The art of complete training has been[.]
lost on the younger generation, I'm afraid.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Yes, that's right! Back in our day,[.]
fighters had to learn many disciplines[A]
in case they had to fill in for a 
wounded teammate.[.][A]
I've always wanted to learn archery.[A]
The delicate precision is the opposite of[.]
fighting with an axe.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Me, too. Why don't we meet sometime[.]
and study it together?[A][OpenMidLeft]That's a great idea![A]
[0CB7]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x10E][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x123][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]Garcia![.][A][OpenMidLeft]Hello there, Dozla![.][A][OpenMidRight]I had a great time last time![.][A][OpenMidLeft]Yes, indeed.[A][OpenMidRight]I just love sparring! It's like having
a conversation, except with weapons![A][OpenMidLeft]You DO know that you're not supposed to[.]
swing the bow like an axe, right? Ha ha![A][OpenMidRight]I was only clowning around![.][A]
I'm recalling that a certain someone
loaded the arrow in the wrong direction[.][A]
and nearly impaled his shoulder.
Hmmm. Now, who could that have been?[A][OpenMidLeft]That was a defect in the arrow![.][A][OpenMidRight][MoveMidRight][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Ha ha ha ha ha! I'm sure![.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Maybe you just can't teach old
dogs new tricks.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]I don't believe that's true at all.[.][A]
You're magnificent with an axe. How 
hard can it be to learn something new?[A][OpenMidLeft]No, you're the great one. 
You're a menace to the enemy![.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]Where did you learn to fight like that?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Well, I used to lead troops in Renais.
I learned the basics there[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
Once I retired, I was living on a mountain.[.][A]
My daily chores involved swinging an axe,[.]
although just for splitting firewood.[.][A][OpenMidRight]See? You learned how to apply your skills[.]
to different fields.[A]
Maybe archery just isn't our thing. We
should try something else.[A][OpenMidLeft]What do you suggest?[A][OpenMidRight]How about magic?[A][OpenMidLeft]Hmmm[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]It can't be that difficult to learn.[A]
As far as I can tell, it's just a bunch[.]
of arm waving and shouting gibberish.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]You do have a point.[A][OpenMidRight]Let's practice sometime soon.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]I'm looking forward to it[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]Mage![.][A][OpenMidRight][MoveMidRight][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Ha ha ha ha! Yes, indeed![.][A][ToggleSmile]
[0CB8]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x123][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x10E][OpenMidRight]That did not go as well as I had hoped.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Well, that's not entirely true, is it.[A][OpenMidRight]It would have helped if you hadn't
whacked me in the head with the staff.[A][OpenMidLeft]I didn't mean to hit you! You just got
in the way when I was[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]conjuring.[A][OpenMidRight]I still have a lump on my head.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]I feel badly about it, all right?[.][A]
Besides, I think you're forgetting
that I also healed you with that staff![.][A][OpenMidRight]No, you didn't! 
You burned my beard clear off![A][OpenMidLeft]Oh, yes. That's right.[.....]
I'm sorry.[A][OpenMidRight]Hmph.[.][A][OpenMidLeft][MoveMidLeft][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]You have to admit, though, you looked[.]
quite dashing without that beard.[.][A]
It took at least ten years off of your
appearance. No, at least twenty![A][OpenMidRight]You really think so?[.....]
I can't stop smelling burnt hair.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]But, wait! At least give me credit for [.]
making it grow back that quickly.[.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][.....]
Very well.[A]
It grew back nicely. Thank you.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]You're welcome![.][A][OpenMidRight]This little foray into other disciplines [.]
has certainly taught me a lot.[A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Me, too![A]
After all this, sword fighting
should be a piece of cake![A][ToggleSmile]

you were doing.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]I'm preparing myself for the battle.
Please don't come near me right now.[A][OpenMidRight]Are you trying to get psyched?[A][OpenMidLeft]Yes.[A]
To prepare myself for battle, I visualize[.]
the enemy in front of me. [A]
Then, during battle, I can focus all my[.]
attention on them.[A]
If you want to survive this war, you must[.]
focus all your attention on the enemy.[A][OpenMidRight]I-I see. Please excuse me now![A][OpenMidLeft]Wait![.][A][OpenMidRight]Y-yes, sir?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]I apologize for yelling at you.[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidRight]That must be how he became such a

the gold falcon[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]Huh? Oh, this? My late grandfather gave[.]
it to me.[.][A]
It was too big for me, so I resized it
to fit my hand.[.][A]
He was the one who taught me how to use 
a bow[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
This is a keepsake he gave me.[A][OpenRight][MoveMidRight][OpenMidRight]Is your grandfather's name Zethla?[A][OpenMidLeft]How in the world[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]?[.]
Did you know him?[.][A][OpenMidRight]Of course. He was THE master archer.
He was known as [OpenQuote]Single-Arrow Zethla.[CloseQuote][A]
He had amazing accuracy and could shoot[.]
any target, moving or still, with one shot.[.][A]
[OpenQuote]No second arrow for Zethla[CloseQuote] was what 
people would say.[.][A]
Renais tried to recruit him many times[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]Now that I think about it,[A]
when Grandpa went hunting, he would take
only one arrow with him.[A]
[ToggleSmile]Me, I always took many arrows[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]So, it WAS true![A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]He never did join the army, even though[.]
recruiters did come by often.[.][A]
He said that it wasn't in his nature[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]I know. In fact, I visited him once when [.]
I was young.[A]
He was wearing the gauntlet that day,[.]
and it left an impression.[A][OpenMidLeft]I see[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
Renais is such a big country, I never 
would have thought that you knew him.[.][A]
[ToggleSmile]It's a small world.[.][A][ToggleSmile][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]Indeed.[.][A]
I can't believe Single-Arrow Zethla's[.]
granddaughter is fighting in this war.[A]
I'm encouraged by this fact. I'm counting 
on you, Neimi.[A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]What? YOU'RE counting on[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]ME?[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]Yes.[A][OpenMidLeft]Um[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]I'm[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]happy to hear that.[.]
I-I'll do my best not to let you down![A][OpenMidRight]Good. Then let's go.[A][OpenMidLeft]Yes, sir![.][A]
[0CBB]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x10E][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x10A][OpenMidLeft]Neimi, I'm sorry if I startled you yesterday.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Huh? Oh, you mean when you were 
preparing yourself for the battle?[A][Clear]
[ToggleSmile]No[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove] I was just surprised by [.]
your[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]enthusiasm for this war.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]I used to be like this all the time.[A]
I was always preoccupied with battles, to 
the point of neglecting my family.[A]
And now, here I am, back on the 
battlefield.[A]
I'm sure my wife is somewhere sighing.[A][OpenMidRight]Oh, no, Sir Garcia.[.]
[ToggleSmile]I'm sure your wife understood how you felt.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]I think it's hard to understand when
you are not a soldier.[A][OpenMidRight]In times like this, you have to fight to [.]
stay alive.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]You've lost family too, didn't you?[.][A][OpenMidRight]Yes.[.....]
But, I can't keep crying.[.][A]
I have to be strong and keep going.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Neimi[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]You quit the army and lived in a [.]
mountain village with Ross because[A]
Renais was not at war, didn't you?[ToggleMouthMove][A][ToggleMouthMove][OpenMidLeft]Yes.[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]You don't seem to be the type of person 
who enjoys fighting for its own sake.[.][A]
I think you know the emptiness and pain of
war more than anyone else.[A]
I can see that just by looking at you![.....]
Em...[.][A]
I'm sorry if I'm being presumptuous.[A][ToggleSmile][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]No, Neimi. Thank you.[.][A]
You are very perceptive. You'll make some[.]
lucky guy very happy someday.[.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Oh[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove] Um[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
This is kind of embarrassing.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Don't be embarrassed![.]
Oh, by the way, please take this.[.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]What is it?[.][.....]
[ToggleSmile]Oh, this haircomb is lovely![A][OpenMidLeft]I bought this for my wife when
I was still in the Renais army.[.][A]
But[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]I never had the chance to[.]
give it to her.[.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Sir Garcia[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]I buried her with some of the things
I'd brought back.[.][A]
I don't know why, but I couldn't
bring myself to bury this, though.[A]
I don't need it. What would I do with[.]
it? You'd make better use of it.[A]
It will give you a reason to keep[.]
using that mirror of yours, too.[A][OpenMidRight]Sir Garcia! This is too much! Thank you!
I will take good care of it![A]
[0CBC]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x110][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x109][OpenMidRight]Hey, you![.][A][OpenMidLeft]I hope that maniac isn't talking to me.[.]
I'll pretend I can't hear him. La la la.[A][OpenMidRight]You, over there! Mage woman![A][OpenMidLeft]Are you talking to me? Firstly, my name[.]
isn't [OpenQuote]Mage Woman,[CloseQuote] nor is it [OpenQuote]You.[CloseQuote][A]
Why don't you lower your voice and
act a little more civilized? Who are you?[.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I'm son of the warrior Garcia, Ross.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]So you're [OpenQuote]Son-of-warrior-garcia-ross.[CloseQuote][.]
That's an unusual name. [A]
I'm Lute, genius mage extraordinaire. 
You've probably heard of me.[A]
So, Sir Son-of-warrior-garcia-ross, 
how may I be of service to you?[.][A][OpenMidRight][MoveMidRight][OpenMidRight]My name is ROSS! You're kind of weird.[.....]
[ToggleSmile]Hey, you can use magic, right?[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Yes, although to be more accurate,
I don't just [OpenQuote]use[CloseQuote] magic.[.][A]
I am a master of all magic. 
Please don't make that mistake again.[.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Wow, that's really great.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Well, maybe for you. For me, I'm
just that good. It's normal.[A][OpenMidRight]Isn't it hard to remember all those spells?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Well, I think for the average person,[.]
it probably is a difficult task.[A]
But for me, it is as simple as using a
hint of fragrance when baking a cake.[.][A][OpenMidRight]I[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]have no idea what you mean.[.][.....]
[ToggleSmile]Wait a second![A]
Does that mean even I could learn magic?[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]No.[.][A][OpenMidRight][MoveMidRight][OpenMidRight]Hey! At least pretend to ponder the[.]
question for a little bit before you answer.[A][OpenMidLeft]OK. Bye.[A][OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidRight]Hey! [.]
[OpenMidRight][MoveMidRight][OpenMidRight][MoveRight][OpenRight]Hey, wait a minute![.][A]
[0CBD]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x109][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x110][OpenMidLeft]Hey, mage lady! I mean[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove] Let's see[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove] Lute![A][OpenMidRight]Hello, Sir Son-of-warrior-garcia-ross.[A][OpenMidLeft]It's ROSS![A]
You left in the middle [.]
of the conversation![A][OpenMidRight]Thank you, but it's no big deal.[A][OpenMidLeft][MoveMidLeft][OpenMidLeft]That wasn't a compliment![.][.....][A][Clear]
[ToggleSmile]So, by the way[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]So long.[A][OpenMidLeft][MoveMidLeft][OpenMidLeft]What the heck? Hey, wait a minute!
I was telling you not to leave suddenly![A][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x110][OpenMidRight]What do you want?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Well, nothing in particular. I just thought[.]
we could chat[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]or something.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Well, THAT doesn't sound very productive [.]
nor strategically important, but[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
If you want to, please go ahead.[A][OpenMidLeft]OK. Um. Let's see. What to talk about.[.....]
You know, my mom used a little magic, too.[A]
She passed away a while ago[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
But, that's why I thought I might be able[.]
to use magic, too.[A]
Last time, you said no right away, but
you hadn't heard the whole story.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Do you want to be a mage?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]No, not exactly.[A][OpenMidRight]Well, then you should keep following [.]
your own instinct instead.[A]
Everyone has his or her own talent.[.][A]
I figure the path you are taking now is 
appropriate for you.[A][OpenMidLeft]Yeah.[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
[ToggleSmile]Maybe you're right.[.][A]
Well, it's not like I was torn between [.]
the two or anything.[A]
I kinda just wanted to talk with [.]
a female mage like you. Thanks.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]Um, you're welcome, I guess.
I'm glad I could be of your service.[A]
[0CBE]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x109][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x110][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yo, Lute.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]Hi, Son-of--I mean--Ross.[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Hey, you remembered my name finally![A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]Because I'm good.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Huh?[A][OpenMidRight]Are you here to insult me today?[A][OpenMidLeft]Where'd you get that from?! You are as [.]
strange as ever. [.][A][OpenMidRight]Thank you very much.[A][OpenMidLeft]That wasn't a compliment![.][.....]
Have you always been like this?[.][A][OpenMidRight]You mean, have I always been brilliant?[.]
Well, I've been me. So, yes.[A]
I've been surrounded by books for as long 
as I can remember.[A][OpenMidLeft]You studied magic since you were a kid?! [.]
Did you do anything for fun?[A][OpenMidRight]Well, there's my monk-watching habit.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Huh? Never mind.
How about your mother and father?[.][A][OpenMidRight]I don't have any memory of my parents.[A]
But according to my grandmother, they are[.]
traveling in distant lands.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Oh[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[ToggleSmile]So you have a grandmother. [.]
What is she like?[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]She's like an elegant goldfish that's been
sun-dried with a wildflower.[A][OpenMidLeft]I have no idea what you're talking about.[.][A][OpenMidRight]OK then. So long.[.][A][OpenMidRight][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft]Hey![....]
[OpenMidLeft][MoveLeft][OpenLeft]Hey, Lute![A][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x110][OpenMidRight]Yes?[A][OpenLeft]You may be a great mage, but [.]
you don't seem to be physically strong.[.][A]
So, from now on[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove] Well[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
[ToggleSmile]I'll be at your side to protect you.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]Well, that's very kind.[.][A]
But you know that the more likely scenario [.]
is that I'll be protecting you.[.][A][OpenLeft][MoveLeft][OpenLeft]That's not what you're supposed to say![.]
You're just supposed to say [OpenQuote]Yes[CloseQuote]![A][OpenMidRight]OK. Yes.[A][OpenLeft]Man[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[ToggleSmile]I might not seem that tough now,[A]
but someday I will grow up to be a man as[.]
strong as my dad. You wait and see![.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]OK. I'll look forward to it.[A]
But I won't get my hopes too high.
Disappointment is a cruel mistress.[.][A][OpenLeft]You! Grrr!
I'll show you![A]
[0CBF]
[OpenLeft][LoadFace][0x109][OpenFarFarLeft][LoadFace][0x119][.......][OpenFarFarLeft][MoveFarLeft][OpenFarLeft][MoveFarLeft][OpenFarLeft]Zowie![A][OpenLeft]Ugh![A][CloseSpeechSlow][OpenLeft][MoveRight][OpenRight][ClearFace][OpenFarLeft][ClearFace][OpenFarFarLeft][LoadFace][0x119][OpenFarFarRight][LoadFace][0x109][OpenFarFarRight]Hey! Ow! What the heck?![A][OpenFarFarLeft]I'm so sorry! I'm just very clumsy.[.]
Are you all right?[A][OpenFarFarLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x119][OpenFarFarRight]Oooooow![A][OpenFarFarRight][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x109][OpenMidLeft]E-excuse me.[A][OpenMidRight]You! You're from Grado, aren't you![.]
This was a sneak attack, wasn't it![.][A]
Then prepare yourself for battle![.][A][OpenMidLeft]Oh, no! Please listen to me![A]
It's true that I am from Grado, 
but I am now on your side![A][OpenMidRight]You must think I'm pretty gullible![.]
You can't trick me like that![.][A][OpenMidLeft][MoveMidLeft][OpenMidLeft]But I'm telling the truth! I am on your side! 
I didn't attack you.[A]
I tripped and fell into you, but it was[.]
an accident![A][OpenMidRight]Right[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][.....]
Let's say for a second I buy this story.[A]
But how can you explain tripping when[.]
there's nothing around to trip on?[A][OpenMidLeft]There was a dent over there, and--[A][OpenMidRight]Huh?[.....]
Oh, you mean that.[A]
I see. You tripped on that thing, huh?[A][OpenMidLeft]Y-yes![A][OpenMidRight]How could you have tripped on that?[.]
I can barely even see it![.][A]
Hey, isn't that spear a little heavy for you?[.]
You're so small. Need a little help?[A][OpenMidLeft]Not really. It's much lighter than [.]
other knights'.[.][A]
I'm working on building up more power,
but I'm getting the hang of it.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Hmmm[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
I noticed that your armor is very shiny.[A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Um, yes. Thanks, I guess. I'm always
polishing it.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]That's a sure sign of a new recruit!
Watch out for hazing.[.][A]
You might as well be wearing a sign taped[.]
to your forehead that says [OpenQuote]I'm a rookie![CloseQuote][A][OpenMidLeft]Oh[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove] Um[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]Don't worry. I've got your back.[A][OpenMidLeft]What?[.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]But in exchange, you must cover ME when[.]
someone attacks me with a sword![A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Oh[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove] OK. I'll do my best![.][.....]
Um[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove] Say[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]What is it?[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Thank you[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][.....]
for believing me that I'm not your enemy.[.][A][ToggleSmile][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]There's no point in fighting with[.]
someone on your own side.[.][A]
OK, let's go![.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Yes![A]
[0CC0]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x119][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x109][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]Hey![A][OpenMidLeft]Oh, hi, [ToggleSmile]um[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I guess I haven't told you my name, huh.
I'm Ross, the son of the warrior Garcia.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]I'm Amelia. Nice to meet you, Ross.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Likewise. By the way, it looks like you're
getting better at battle.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Yes. It's mostly because you and others 
are helping me out.[.][A]
I'm also getting the hang of my spear.[A][OpenMidRight]I see. I was once a rookie too.[.]
Everyone has to start somewhere.[A]
We're young, and we start at the
bottom of the chain, you know?[A]
But we'll get stronger, both of[.]
us. So let's work hard, all right?[A][OpenMidLeft]Yes![A][OpenMidRight]Good, good.[.]
Oh, by the way[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]Yes?[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I have something for you.[.]
Now, where did I put it? Hmm[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[ToggleSmile]Ah, here it is.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Thanks[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove] Um, what is it?[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Isn't it obvious? It's a necklace.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I can see that, but[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove] [.][ToggleSmile]Why?[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I bought it.
I mean, I bought it a long time go.[.][A]
There was a kid selling this on the street, 
and he just wouldn't leave me alone.[A]
I didn't need it, but he seemed really [.]
hungry, so[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]That's very kind of you, Ross.[A][OpenMidRight][MoveMidRight][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Oh, it's not a big deal. [.]
A-anyway, it's yours now.[.][A][ToggleSmile][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft][MoveMidLeft][OpenMidLeft]What?! I couldn't![A][OpenMidRight]No, it's yours.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]But[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]Don't you like it?[A][OpenMidLeft]It's not that. It's very pretty! It's just[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]Then keep it.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Thank you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][HalfCloseEyes][OpenMidLeft][Clear][ToggleSmile]It's so lovely.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]You should have just accepted in the first
place. Why are you acting so reluctant?[.][A][OpenMidLeft][0x0080][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Well, I've always lived very[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]modestly.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Huh? What's that got to do with it?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]I could never afford something like this[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
So to me, everything is so very precious[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
And I couldn't take something that was [.]
precious to you[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]I see.
[ToggleSmile]Please just take it and enjoy it.[.][A][ToggleSmile][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]If you're sure[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove] Thank you.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Of course![A]
Besides, I've always looked better in 
earrings than necklaces. Just kidding![A]
OK, let's go, Amelia.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Ha ha ha! Sure.[.][A]
[0CC1]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x119][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x109][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Hi, Ross.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Hey, Amelia.
I heard you're getting better.[A][OpenMidLeft]Yes, I'm getting there.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Well, it's a hard road to get to where [.]
we think we should be.[A][OpenMidLeft]Yup, that's true.[.][A][OpenMidRight]As for me, my father was always the warrior[.]
in the family.[A]
I've always wanted to be just like him.[.][A]
I think I'm just finally starting to get [.]
close to that goal.[.][A]
But anyways, how are your parents?[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Well[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft][HalfCloseEyes][OpenMidLeft]I don't talk about them much[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]Oh! Um[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight][HalfCloseEyes][OpenMidRight]I'm sorry. I didn't mean to[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]No, no. It's fine.[A]
My father has been gone for as long as [.]
I can remember[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]I see.[A][OpenMidLeft]I was living with my mother, but[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseEyes][OpenMidLeft]But she is[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]no longer with me.[A][OpenMidRight]I see[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
Sounds like you've had a rough life[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft][HalfCloseEyes][OpenMidLeft]Well[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]I'm sorry I brought up something painful.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Um[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]Um[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][.....][OpenMidRight][OpenEyes][OpenMidRight][0x0080][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]I've got it!
I'll be your big brother![.][A][OpenMidLeft][OpenEyes][OpenMidLeft][0x0080][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]What in the world are you talking about?[A][OpenMidRight]Your brother! And you'll be my sister! Yeah!
This is the best idea I've had in a while![A]
It doesn't matter that we're not blood
relatives.[A]
[ToggleSmile]The army is like a family, so we are
like siblings![A]
So it's decided, then. You're my little sister [.]
from now on. So you're not alone anymore.[.][A]
You can call me big brother, OK?[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Um[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove] This is all kind of[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]sudden.[.]
I don't know if I'm ready to--[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Never mind all that! We're brother and
sister from now on. All right, Sis?[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]How old are you anyway?[.][A][OpenMidRight]Huh? What's that got to do with it?[.][A][OpenMidRight][MoveRight][OpenRight]You know[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove] [.]
Old enough to show you the ropes.[.][A][OpenMidLeft][MoveLeft][OpenLeft]Wait a minute[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][.....]
You're probably the same age as me![.][A][OpenRight][MoveRight][OpenRight]What?![A][OpenLeft]In fact, I'll bet I'm a little older[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenRight]Grrrrrr! Be quiet!
I said I'm the big brother.[.][A]
It doesn't matter the exact date we're born.
I'm the big brother.[A]
Any way you look at it, I'm the older one![A][OpenLeft][ToggleSmile]Ha ha! You're too funny! It's so cute[.]
when you get mad! Hee hee hee![A][ToggleSmile][OpenRight]Grrrrr.[.][A][OpenLeft][ToggleSmile]Thanks for the laugh.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenRight]Hmph! When this war is over, I'll take you [.]
to my village.[A][OpenLeft]What?[.][A][OpenRight]Haven't you been listening to anything?[.]
We're brother and sister now, remember?[.][A][OpenLeft]Um, right.[A][OpenRight]From now on, you and I are going to share 
both joy and sorrow as a family. OK?[A][OpenLeft]If I didn't know better, I would think that[.]
you were proposing to me. Ha ha ha![.][A][OpenRight]What![.][......]
[OpenRight][MoveRight][OpenRight][MoveRight][OpenRight]That's not what I'm talking about at all![.]
You twisted my words up! Just forget it![A]
Anyways, let's go![A][OpenRight][ClearFace][OpenLeft][ToggleSmile]Ha ha ha![.][A]
[ToggleSmile][OpenLeft][HalfCloseEyes][OpenLeft][ToggleSmile]Thanks[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]BIG BROTHER! Hee hee![.][A][ToggleSmile]
[0CC2]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x121][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x109][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]Here you are. I finally tracked you down.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Hi. Um. Who are you?[A][OpenMidRight]I'm Ross. You?[A][OpenMidLeft]I'm Ewan.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Hey, Ewan. Nice to meet you.[A]
I've been looking for someone around my age.
Let's hang out sometime, OK?[A][OpenMidLeft]Sure, but do we have to wait until
[OpenQuote]sometime[CloseQuote]? How about now?[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]What are you saying?
We're in the middle of a battle![A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]The others are fighting well, so the
two of us won't make much difference.[.][A]
Besides, even though I just started using 
magic the other day, I'm pretty good.[.][A]
If something does happen, we'll be OK.[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Well, I'm pretty confident in my [.]
skills, too.[A]
But, you know--how to put this delicately--[.]
it's the matter of morale. [.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]You certainly are dedicated.[.....]
[ToggleSmile]That's a surprise.[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Hey![A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Why don't you prove your dedication[.]
by answering this brainteaser?[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Like a riddle? Sounds fun![A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Yes. It'll be really fun to watch you[.]
struggling to come up with an answer. Ha![.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Hey! What's that supposed to mean?
Well, whatever. Let's do it.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]OK, here it is.[.]
Ross, do you know what a balance is?[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Of course I do! Who doesn't?[A]
It's a type of scale with small plates
on both sides to put weights.[.][A]
When both sides are the same weight,
it balances.[A]
So that was the riddle? Easy![.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Ha ha ha! You're too funny! No, that was [.]
just the setup for the brainteaser.[.][A]
Here's the real question.[.]
Assume there are 25 pebbles.[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Pebbles?[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Yes, they're really small. As small as peas.
They are all the same color and shape.[A]
In this group, there's one pebble that's
lighter than all the other pebbles.[.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]And I must tell you the way to [.]
find that pebble?[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Of course not. [.]
What kind of challenge is that?[.][A]
The question is, how many times do you need[.]
to use the balance to find that one rock?[.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]How many times? Uh[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
It's not[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]24, is it?[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]What?![......]
[OpenMidLeft][MoveMidLeft][OpenMidLeft][MoveMidLeft][OpenMidLeft]Oh! Ha ha ha ha ha![.]
That's the first time I've heard that one![A]
I see. So you were thinking that you'd [.]
measure the pebbles one by one![.][A]
That's great, Ross! You're too funny![.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]That's not a compliment, is it.[.]
You think I'm an idiot![.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]That's not true.[.....]
Actually, it is. Ha ha ha![A]
And did I mention how[.]
perceptive you are, too?[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Oh, you! Just you wait! I'll figure it out![.]
I just need some time to think about it.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]The anticipation is killing me.[.][A]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x121][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x109][OpenMidRight]Hey, you![.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Oh, hi, Ross.[.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I have an answer for your brainteaser![A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]You got it, huh? That's amazing![A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Y-yeah.[.]
The answer is[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Yes, yes?[.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Four times![.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]You must have worked really hard to figure
that out![.][A][OpenMidRight]See! See! I told you I'd get it!
Fighting's not the only thing I'm good at.[A][OpenMidLeft]However, that's not the correct answer.[.][A][OpenMidRight][MoveMidRight][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]What do you mean?[.]
I can't believe it! Ugh![A]
If that's not the right answer, then [.]
what is?[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]You were close. 
The right answer is three times.[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Only three times?[.]
How? Tell me![.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]The key is how many pebbles you put on the
scales at first.[A]
First, put eight rocks each on either side [.]
of the scale.[.][A]
The side with the lighter rock will be
higher than the other, right?[.][A]
Or, if the sides are balanced, it means that
the lighter rock is in the rest of the pile.[A]
So that was one turn on the balance. [.]
The rest is pretty easy to figure out.[A]
Let's assume that the lighter rock was
in the remaining pile of nine rocks[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
Then you'd put three rocks on each side of
the scale. So that's the second turn.[.][A]
If either side of the scale tips, then
the rock is in one of those two piles.[A]
If the scale is balanced, then the rock[.]
is one of the remaining three rocks.[A]
So, now you've figured out which group
of three pebbles has the lighter one.[.][A]
What you do now is put one rock from this[.]
pile on each side of the scale.[.][A]
Like before, if the scale tips to one side, 
the lighter pebble is on the scale.[.][A]
If the scale is balanced, then the
remaining pebble is the lighter one.[A]
And that was the last turn on the[.]
scale. Did you get all that?[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Huh? Well, I think I got it[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]What?! I just explained it all very clearly.
You still don't get it? That's really[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Really what?![.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Um, nothing. Forget it. A ha ha ha ha![A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile][OpenQuote]A ha ha ha[CloseQuote] what? [.]
What do you mean [OpenQuote]forget it[CloseQuote]?[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Anyway, it's been fun hanging out.
Let's get together again sometime, OK?[A][OpenMidRight]It wasn't fun for me at all! Hey![.][A]
[0CC4]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x121][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x109][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Hi, Ross.[.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Oh, it's you again.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]That brainteaser was fun, huh?
Did you get it yet?[.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I already told you I didn't[.]
have any fun![.][A]
If that's what you consider fun, you
must have had a pretty bad childhood![.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Well, I was an orphan.[A][OpenMidRight]Oh[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]My sister and I were abandoned when I was[.]
really young, before I could even talk.[.][A]
She became a dancer and raised me all on
her own.[A]
I'm really grateful for her.[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]You were an orphan?[.][A][ToggleSmile][CloseSpeechSlow][OpenMidRight][HalfCloseEyes][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I-I'm sorry. I had no idea.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight][OpenEyes][OpenMidLeft]How could you know? Don't worry about it.[.]
I don't even remember being abandoned.[A]
And because of that, I got a chance to [.]
travel around, and meet lots of people.[.][A]
Like you. So, I'm not sad at all.[.][A][OpenMidRight][HalfCloseEyes][OpenMidRight][OpenEyes][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I see[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[Clear][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight][0x0080][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Hey, I just had a great idea.[.]
Let's be brothers?[A][ToggleSmile][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Huh?! Like blood brothers? I'm really not[.]
into slicing myself up for people I just met.[.][A][OpenMidRight]No, no, no. Just, you know, brothers![.]
Now call me [OpenQuote]Bro,[CloseQuote] Bro![.][A][OpenMidLeft]Um[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove] OK[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]Bro.[A][OpenMidRight]Say it like you mean it![.....]
Oh, never mind. It'll just sound forced.[A][OpenMidLeft]I told you so.[A][OpenMidRight]Well, just call me Ross for now.[A]
[ToggleSmile]But, you can consider me a brother
from now on.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]What do you mean by that?[.][A][OpenMidRight]I mean that I will be a friend who
you can rely on and trust completely.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]That's very kind, considering I really
haven't known you for very long.[A]
But thank you. You're a nice guy, even
if you're not very sharp.[.][A][OpenMidRight][MoveMidRight][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Hey! No need to insult me!
A simple [OpenQuote]Thanks, Bro[CloseQuote] will be enough![A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Ha ha ha ha ha. You're so funny!
By the way, do you have a girlfriend?[.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]W-what! Of course not! Did you forget? [.]
We're in the middle of a war right now![.][A]
I have to focus on that![A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Huh.[.....]
A ha ha ha ha![A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]What's that for?
How about you? Do you have one?[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]I have a lot of them![.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]What?! A lot of them![.]
Oh well. We're still pretty young.[A]
Better to not get tied down.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Good luck, Ross![A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Don't talk like it's not your problem, too![.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Hey, Ross.[A]
I think we're going to be friends for a long
time. In fact, I know it.[.][A][OpenMidRight]OK. Boy, you're such a laid-back guy[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[0CC5]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x11B][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x109][OpenMidRight]Um[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove] Ahem.[A]
Are you Sir Gerik by any chance?[A][OpenMidLeft]What do you want, boy?[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Oh, my name is Ross.
I'm the son of warrior Garcia.[A][ToggleSmile][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]I see[.][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove]
So, Ross, are you an axeman?[A][OpenMidRight]Yeah! Don't be fooled by my appearance.[.]
I'm actually pretty good.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Ha ha ha! If you say so.[A][OpenMidRight]Well, I think so. 
But it's important to keep improving.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Why is that so important to you?[A][OpenMidRight]My father is such an amazing warrior.[.][A]
I've always wanted to be worthy of
the title [OpenQuote]son of Garcia.[CloseQuote][A]
And I want to be able to go home and [.]
rebuild my village.[.][A]
After that, I want to go on a voyage and
train in the open ocean.[A]
And after that, I'd like to go back home.[.][A]
To do all this, I need to be the best[.]
warrior I can be.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Those are admirable goals. [.]
I'll help you out sometime.[.][A][OpenMidRight]How? You'll give me a lesson?[.][.....]
[OpenMidRight][MoveMidRight][OpenMidRight]Are you serious? That's great![A][OpenMidLeft]I might not be able to beat your father,
but I could teach you a thing or two.[.][A]
Why don't you try landing a hit on me?[A][OpenMidRight]That'd be great! But before we start,[.]
let me go practice on those guys first![.][A][OpenMidRight][ClearFace][.....][OpenMidLeft]It's great that he's so eager to learn,[.]
but he's really not ready to go solo yet![.][A]
[0CC6]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x109][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x11B][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]Ross, didn't you say that you wanted to go [.]
on an ocean voyage to train yourself?[.][A]
The sea is a great place to train because[.]
it strengthens both the mind and body.[A][OpenMidLeft]Have you ever been on a voyage?[.][A][OpenMidRight]Of course. I've escorted many commercial [.]
ships before.[.][A]
It's embarrassing, but I got seasick for [.]
the first few days.[.][A]
That was very painful.
But I got used to it in a few days.[.][A]
It was a long trip. Nature was more brutal
than the enemies who pursued us.[A]
But after the voyage ended, I realized that[.]
I grew up a lot.[A]
The sea is an amazing combination of [.]
brutality and expansiveness.[A][OpenMidLeft]Now I definitely want to go on a [.]
sea voyage.[.][A][OpenMidRight]By the way, Ross, how's your injury from
our last session?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Oh, that little thing? It healed right up![A][OpenMidRight]Ha ha ha[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
You sure are tough, boy![A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Sir Gerik?[A][OpenMidRight]Yes?[A][OpenMidLeft]What should I do to be strong like you?[.][A][OpenMidRight]That's a tough question[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove] I would [.]
have to say that it's all in the mind.[A][OpenMidLeft]Mind?[.][A][OpenMidRight]If your desire to win is stronger than your[.]
opponent's, you've already won.[.][A]
Your mind is your most important weapon.[A][OpenMidLeft]Come to think of it, I have noticed that.[.][A]
At our last lesson, before we even started,[.]
I was thinking that I could never win.[A]
I guess it was like admitting defeat before[.]
even trying.[A]
[ToggleSmile]All right! You've convinced me![.][A]
I'll start strengthening my mind as well
as my axe skills.[.][A]
Thank you, Sir Gerik.[.]
I can't wait until our next lesson![.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][.....][OpenMidRight]His energy is refreshing, but I must teach
him patience next time.[.][A]
[0CC7]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x109][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x11B][OpenMidLeft]Hey, Sir Gerik[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]What is it, Ross? You seem down today.[A][OpenMidLeft]Why is the sword stronger than the axe?[.][A][OpenMidRight]What are you talking about?[.]
Just use a stronger axe to beat a sword.[A][OpenMidLeft]That's not what I mean![.][A]
I want to be strong enough to split[.]
a silver sword with an iron axe.[A][OpenMidRight]Your father[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]What about him?[.][A][OpenMidRight]He could defeat many swordsmen
with just one axe.[A][OpenMidLeft]So you've seen him in battle?[.][A][OpenMidRight]Just once.
He was leading a unit of the Renais army.[.][A]
He was swinging his axe at the front line.[A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Wow, my dad was really strong, wasn't he![.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]He was more than just strong. 
He was like a war god.[A]
I have to be honest with you, Ross.[.]
I was on his enemy side at the time.[A][OpenMidLeft]What?![A][OpenMidRight]I was a mercenary hired by the other side.[A]
It was a fierce battle against Garcia's[.]
unit, and we ultimately had to retreat.[.][A]
Come to think of it, this is a perfect [.]
example of the power of the mind.[.][A]
You see, I was so intimidated by Garcia that
I had lost even before I started.[.][A]
That was an unforgettable failure for me.[.][A]
After that, I swore to myself that I would [.]
be as strong as him with a sword.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Wow, I can't believe Dad beat you down [.]
like that! He's the greatest.[.][A]
But you're pretty great, too.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Someone who lost to your father?[A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yeah![.][A]
You might have lost that time, but you [.]
became a great swordsman because of it![.][A]
OK. I'm going to stop moping around.[A]
From this moment on, I swear that someday 
I will destroy swords with my axe.[A]
You are my witness, Sir Gerik![A][ToggleSmile][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]Truly, you are the son
of the warrior Garcia.[A][OpenMidLeft]That's not all! I'm also the best student of
the master swordsman Gerik![.][A][OpenMidRight]When did you become my student?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]When I met you![.][......]
Oh![.][....] Enemy detected![A]
I'll catch you later![.]
Give me another lesson someday, Sir Gerik.[A]
I'll be much stronger by then, and maybe
I'll win a match with you![A][OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][......][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I believe he will surpass Garcia someday.[.][A][ToggleSmile]
[0CC8]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x10A][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x10C][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]Neimi.[A][OpenMidLeft]Oh, hi, Colm[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
How are you doing?[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]This is no time for pleasantries![.]
You need to concentrate in battle![A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]I was just being polite[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]I never thought I'd see you on the [.]
battlefield.[A][OpenMidLeft]Well, I might not be the best, but when[.]
something needs to be done[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]I do it.[A][OpenMidRight]It's amazing how war affects people.
I mean, look at you.[A]
You're a bumbling crybaby, but even you've
pulled yourself together temporarily.[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Uh...[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]When we were little, you followed me [.]
everywhere, tripping and crying[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft][HalfCloseEyes][OpenMidLeft]Oh! Sniff[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove] [.]
Why are you always so mean? Waaa![.][A][OpenMidLeft][CloseEyes][OpenMidRight]And now look at you! You're still following[.]
me everywhere, tripping and crying,[.][A]
but now you're doing it on the battlefield.[.][.....]
Will you PLEASE stop your boo-hooing?[.][A][OpenMidLeft][HalfCloseEyes][OpenMidLeft]Sniff[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
OK[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove] I'll try[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][A][ToggleMouthMove][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Man, you can't do anything without me, [.]
can you! And stop crying![.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft][OpenEyes][OpenMidLeft]But[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove] Sniff[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]What is it?![A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]You're the one who's[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]making me cry.[A][OpenMidRight]Ugh![A]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x10A][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x10C][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Whew![.][A][OpenMidRight]What are you doing?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Oh! C-Colm[ToggleMouthMove]...[.]
I-I was just restringing my bow[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][ToggleMouthMove][OpenMidRight]Wow. You really take after your grandfather.
The way you handle your bow is great![.][A][OpenMidLeft]Grandpa taught me how to shoot
when I was little[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]Yeah. Your grandfather was
a really top-notch archer.[A]
[ToggleSmile]I still remember how he[.]
tried to shoot me.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]W-well, Colm[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
That's because you were stealing
fruit from our tree.[A][OpenMidRight]He really taught me how frightening[.]
an archer with a good shot can be.[A][OpenMidLeft]But[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove] He never hurt you.[.][A]
He just wanted to scare you. [.]
He missed on purpose.[.][A][OpenMidRight]No, he was aiming for me. I was 
just too fast for him to hit me.[A][OpenMidLeft]He never missed a target [.]
when we went hunting.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Well, then, I guess I'm just [.]
faster than wild animals.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Hee hee! Ha ha ha![A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Hey! You're laughing at me, aren't you?[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Hee hee! That's not true[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
It's just that[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove] You haven't [.]
changed much since then.[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]What's that supposed to mean?[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]J-just that you still exaggerate a lot.[.][A]
But now that I think about it, you've 
always been on my side.[.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Not always![.][A]
And now especially, I can't[.]
always be there to protect you.[.][A]
I have many responsibilities
to this unit, you know.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]I know[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]But I can't leave you[.]
alone, either.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Thank you[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]

attack you? Are you hurt?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]No[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]Did someone say something mean to you?

You shouldn't cry so much.[A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I know.[.]
The other day, when I was in battle,[A]
I was remembering all the times you[.]
helped me when we were little.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]Oh?[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Like that time I fell into the
river and you came and rescued me.[A]
Or the time I broke Grandpa's bow.
You helped me fix it.[.][A]
And all the times bullies picked on[.]
me, you defended me.[A][ToggleSmile][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]Seriously, Neimi.[.]
You've always been such a crybaby.[A][OpenMidLeft]Yes, but[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
Because you were there with me,[.]

If anything is troubling you,[.]
come see me first, all right?[.][A]
I'll take care of anyone who
makes you cry.[A][OpenMidLeft]I will[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]I think your haplessness is permanent.

[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x10C][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x11E][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Hey, you![.]
Have you seen a scary-looking woman?[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]Scary-looking woman?
Is she your sister?[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]NO. 
I don't have any sisters.[.][A]
The woman I'm talking about was 
beautiful, but also very scary.[.][A]
Have you seen someone who fits that[.]
description?[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]I don't think so.[.][A]
Beautiful but very scary[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
What do you mean by that?[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Well, I'm not exactly sure, either.[.][A]
I just heard from one of Gerik's mercenaries
that there is a woman sword fighter here.[.][A]
Apparently, she's very talented and was 
hired for an unbelievable sum.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]A woman sword fighter??[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Rumor is that if you speak to her[.]
without thinking,[.][A]
she's likely to attack you out of nowhere![A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]Is that so.[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Maybe her face is scarred from
fighting. Yeah, that's probably it![.][A]
She's beautiful, but has a very sad[.]
past behind that scar.[A]
And that's why she's so scary![A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]A scarred face?[.]
A sad past?[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Or maybe it's because her lover was[.]
killed, and she's trying to avenge him.[.][A]
That seems equally plausible, doesn't it?[.][A]
Anyway, if you see her around, would you [.]
tell her that I was looking for her?[A]
See ya.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][......][OpenMidRight]Well, I'm the only female sword fighter[.]
here. I guess he was looking for me.[A]
He is so clueless[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]

I figured out that you were the scary[.]
woman I was talking about.[A]
I'm Colm. Nice to meet you.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]OK.[.][.....]
So, what did you want from me?[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Oh, nothing special.[A]
I just wanted to meet the famous
swordswoman.[A]
I was going to challenge you to a match,[A]
but I've seen you fight and know how good 
you are. You'd beat me senseless.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]I'll accept a match with you anytime.[.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Well, I don't know how else to say this.[.....]
[ToggleSmile]You're scaring me.[A][OpenMidLeft]Scaring?[A][OpenMidRight]Yeah. It sounds funny, but you never
look at the enemy[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
I mean[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]you don't care about the
enemy at all.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]I have no idea what you're talking about.[.]
Speak English.[A][OpenMidRight]I mean[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove] Even when the enemy is[.]
right in front of you,[A]
you aren't even looking at him. 
You're fighting something else.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Something else?[.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I'm not that smart, and I don't know [.]
much about swords.[A]
So I can't say exactly who or what it is
you are really fighting.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]I see.[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Um[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove] What I mean to say is [.]
good luck in all your battles. Um[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
That's it. See you later![.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]The enemy[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]I'm really fighting?[A]

Is that what you're talking about?[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Yes.[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]What about it?[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Do you want to know?
What I'm really fighting with?[A][OpenMidRight]Huh? Y-yeah[.][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove]

in Jehanna. He was also a mercenary.[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I see why you're so good.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Ever since I was a child, my father 
taught me how to live as a mercenary.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Since you were a kid?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]The harsh conditions of Jehanna breed[.]
strength and ruthlessness.[A]
The only way to survive is by being 
a mercenary.[ToggleMouthMove][A][ToggleMouthMove][OpenMidRight]Oh.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]My father is my parent, my teacher, and 
above all, a mountain I must conquer.[.][A][OpenMidRight]A mountain?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Once I conquer the mountain, I can
accomplish anything I want.[.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]That must be a[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]big mountain.[.][.....]
So, where are you on the mountain?[A]
A third of the way up? Halfway up?
Or can you already see the summit?[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]I'm only at the base.[.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]You still have a long way to go, huh?[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]Yes.
I don't even know where the summit is yet.[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Well, then, you don't know how long 
it will take, do you?[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]I'll just keep climbing. [.]
Even if it takes me forever[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]Oh. I see.[A]
[ToggleSmile]Well, good luck. I'm sure you'll make 
it to the top.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Yes. Someday. For sure.[.][.....]
You're[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]a nice guy.[.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Ha ha ha! Oh, please.[.]
You're embarrassing me.[.][A][ToggleSmile]
[0CCE]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x124][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x10C][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Hey, you! I know your secret.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Huh?[.....]
My secret?[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]You're a thief, too, aren't you?[A]
Do you think that's acceptable behavior[.]
for someone in the princess's entourage?[A][ToggleSmile][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Ha ha ha! Where'd you learn a big word
like entourage, boy?[A]
Not that it's any of your business,[.][A]
but Her Highness already knows about [.]
my[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]hobbies.[A]
You're not, by any chance, trying to
threaten me, are you?[.][A]
That's funny. I never thought I'd be
reprimanded by a boy![.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Hey, old man, don't you talk down to ME![A]
[ToggleSmile]I'm not a boy. I'm Colm!
And I'm not threatening you, either.[A]
I was just surprised that you're a thief
because you dress so nicely.[A][OpenMidLeft]I assume you're in the same trade. [.]
Those rags are a dead giveaway.[.][A]
Well, you may not take any pride in your
appearance, but I'm different.[A]
Do you see this jacket?[.][A]
It has silk embroidery, a trend that [.]
I started in Carcino.[.][A]
Where are the stitches, you ask?[A]
They're on the inside of the jacket.
But I'm not going to show you.[A]
The truly cultured man cares about [.]
every detail.[.][A]
It would be a waste of my time to even
try to explain it to a poor urchin like you.[A][OpenMidRight]Why are you bragging about something
so lame?[A]
[ToggleSmile]And I'm not a poor urchin! Man, I've [.]
never met anyone as annoying as you![A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Oh, don't be so sensitive, little urchin.[.][A]
If you want to be like me, make more money.[.]
Improve your skills.[A]
The name of the game is making money. 
Money is all that matters.[A]
It's your only way out.[.]
Work hard and escape from poverty.[A][OpenMidRight]First of all, I don't want to be like you!
Second of all, I'll show you![.][A][OpenMidLeft]Well, don't pull a muscle, little urchin![.][A]
[0CCF]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x124][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x10C][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Hey, urchin, have you made any money yet?[.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Stop calling me urchin![.][A]
[ToggleSmile]I heard that your dad is a wealthy [.]
merchant in Carcino.[A][OpenMidLeft]Yes. So what?[.][A]
My father is a wealthy merchant,
and his son is a thief.[.][A]
Great family, huh?[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]If you're rich, you don't need to steal.
You can just buy whatever you want.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]You are so green, boy. Greener than the 
fruit I left out for a month.[.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]What's that supposed to mean?[.][A]
I've never had dried fruit, so I don't
know what you're talking about![.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Oh, that's too bad.[.][A]
[ToggleSmile]Listen, urchin. Merchants are always
stingy. It's part of who they are.[A]
And my father was especially stingy. [.]
He gave us nothing for free.[A]
We had to work for everything we had.[.][A]
So my brothers and I learned the value of[.]
hard work from a young age.[.][A]
[ToggleSmile]And this just happens to be my job.[.]
Get it?[.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]It's not easy being the son of a [.]
merchant, huh?[A]
Forced to work from a young age.
I had a tough childhood, too. [A]
I always had to hunt and garden with [.]
my dad.[.][A]
[ToggleSmile]I guess our lives aren't so different 
after all, huh.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Er, a little hunting and gardening [.]
is quite different from actual work.[A]
You can see that just by looking
at how you and I turned out.[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Well! I'll show you![A]
Maybe you'll wake up one morning and find[.]
that something important to you is gone![A]
Consider yourself warned, old man![A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]You know,[.][A]
warning people of your plans isn't really[.]
the most effective thieving strategy.[.][A]
Anyhow, I look forward to seeing
what you can muster.[A]
[0CD0]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x10C][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x124][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]Hi there, urchin.[.]
I haven't heard you bragging in a while.[A]
I thought maybe you gave up on your 
big plans.[A][OpenMidLeft]I'm more persistent than you think I am.
I came to see you because I remembered--[A]
[ToggleSmile]Wait, you haven't noticed yet?[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Noticed what?[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Ha ha ha! I won![A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]What? Did you actually steal something?[.][....]
Don't tell me[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][.....]
[ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight][MoveMidRight][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]A ha![.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]So you finally noticed![.][A]
Yes, I secretly stole only the embroidery[.]
off your precious jacket.[.][A]
So, how's that for stealth? That's some[.]
pretty fine thieving, if I do say so myself.[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I see. The embroidery IS missing.[.]
Good work.[A]
[ToggleSmile]It's a little early for a victory[.]
celebration, though.[A]
The embroidery was of a pony, correct?[A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Huh? Yeah[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]Unfortunately for you, that was a fake.[.][A]
I knew you would try to steal it, so I
replaced it with a fake beforehand.[.][A]
The real embroidery is of a phoenix.
But I won't show it to you. Nope, never.[A][OpenMidRight][MoveFarRight][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]You! That's a cheap trick![A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft][MoveLeft][OpenFarRight]In this business, anything goes.[A]
However, I'm impressed that you got[.]
as far as you did.[A]
I definitely don't want you for an enemy.[.][A][OpenLeft]Heh heh heh[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove] Same here, I guess.
I'm glad that we're on the same side.[.][A]
Now give me my boots![.][A]
[0CD1]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x118][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x10C][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Kyle, do you have a minute?[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]What is it, Colm?[.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Well[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
It's about Princess Eirika.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Is something the matter with her?[.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]It was a while ago, but when she went 
to bed, she was[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]What happened after she[.]
retired to her room?[A]
Colm, don't toy with me.
Just tell me![.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]The princess looked like she was [.]
having trouble falling asleep.[A]
She kept pacing.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Having trouble falling asleep?[ToggleMouthMove][A][ToggleMouthMove][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yup.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]That's not good.[A]
It's very important for her to get enough[.]
rest during this tough march.[.][A]
This war has been very hard for[.]
Prince Ephraim and Princess Eirika.[.][A]
I'm sure she's probably spent a few 
nights worrying, but--[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Hey! I just remembered that I have this[.]
secret remedy my mother used to make.[.][A]
It started off as a freckle cream,[A]
but it turns out that it works pretty well [.]
with insomnia, too.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Really.[.]
That's a good idea.[.][A]
I'm sure Prince Ephraim and Lady Eirika[.]
would love to have something like that.[.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]OK, then. I'll give it to her next
time I see her.[.][A]
I'll let you know how it goes.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]All right, Colm.[A]
[0CD2]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x118][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x10C][OpenMidRight]Kyle, big news![.][A][OpenMidLeft]What is it this time, Colm?[.][A][OpenMidRight]It's about Prince Ephraim.[A][OpenMidLeft]What? What happened?[A][OpenMidRight]He's just like me![A][OpenMidLeft]Just like you? In what sense?[.][A][OpenMidRight]He hates studying, too![.][A][OpenMidLeft]And...? That doesn't seem[.]
like news or anything.[A][OpenMidRight]It's big news for me! And for you, too![.][A]
The future of Renais is not looking good
if he hates studying as much as I do.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Don't worry about it.[.][A]
He might not like studying much, but
no one is as bad as you.[A]
Besides, if you're bringing this up to
denigrate him, you are in serious trouble.[A][OpenMidRight]Not at all![.][A]
[ToggleSmile]I'm just worried about Prince[.]
Ephraim and Princess Eirika.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]I understand.[.]
But this news was really useless.[.][A]
In the future, please only bring me 
relevant information.[.][A]
[0CD3]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x10C][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x118][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Kyle, I have some useful news![A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]Finally. What is it?[A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Heh heh heh[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove] Well, it's a secret about you.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]A secret about me? What is it?[A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]You have a girlfriend!
Her name is Meriella![.][A]
You send letters to her all[.]
the time, don't you![A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]Oh, that. I've been meaning[.]
to tell you about her.[A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I'm so glad to hear that, Kyle. Let me [.]
know if you need to talk to someone.[A]
Long-distance relationships can be hard.[A]
I can't believe it! 
Stuffy old Kyle is in love![.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]In love? Me?
I think you're confused.[A]
Meriella is not my girlfriend.
She is one of my teammates.[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Workplace romance, is it?[.]
Say no more. I understand.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]Just shut up and listen to me.[A]
Meriella is the alias we use for Renais[.]
knights on undercover missions.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Alias? Like a secret code?[A][OpenMidRight]Precisely.[A]
We send mail addressed to Meriella, which 
only the Renais knights know.[.][A]
The contents are always the same:[.][A]
We let them know that Prince Ephraim and [.]
Princess Eirika are safe.[.][A]
It's all written in secret code.
That's the letter I was sending.[A][OpenMidLeft]Even though we're in the middle of a war,[.]
does it really have to be so complicated?[.][A][OpenMidRight]Yes. Better to be safe than sorry.[A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I see.[A]
Well, would you like me to deliver that[.]
letter?[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]No. Every single soldier is[.]
important in this war.[A]
We need you here.[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Really?[.]
You value my service? Neat![.][A][ToggleSmile][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]Um[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove] Yes.[.][A]
Although you do bring me some pointless 
tidbits, you have also been a big help.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Great! This is so encouraging![A]
Until recently, I thought I'd never have
any real connection with the knights.[.][A]
But it's different now.[.][A]
Now, I consider everyone involved in this 
war, especially the knights like you,[.][A]
to be my friends.[.]
I will always fight for my friends![.][A][OpenMidRight]Thank you, Colm.[A]
Civilians and knights[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
Together, we'll restore peace in Renais.[A]
[0CD4]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x119][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x10A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Whoa[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]That's beautiful! Your
armor, I mean. It's so shiny.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Th-thanks.
Ah[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]Er[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]I'm Neimi.[A][OpenMidLeft]Oh, my name is Amelia.
Nice to meet you, miss.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Miss? Oh, no. I'm just Neimi.[.]
It's nice to meet you, too.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]All right, Neimi it is.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Anyway, your armor really is lovely.[A]
That color reminds me of the michew[.]
berries that grow in my hometown.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Oh, I've had michew berries before![.][A]
They're really shiny, and they're sweet[.]
and a little tart when you eat them.[A]
I just love them in pies[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]Oh, I know! I didn't think they grew
anywhere else. They're so yummy![A][OpenMidLeft]Tell you what: if we come across any in[.]
the field, let's stop and pick them.[A][OpenMidRight]That sounds like a good idea.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Maybe we can use some of the supplies[.]
to bake some michew pies for everyone.[A]
One bite, and they'll forget all
about their exhaustion.[.][A][OpenMidRight]I agree. I'll keep my eyes peeled, and
if I see any, I'll pick some for you.[.][A][OpenMidLeft][MoveMidLeft][OpenMidLeft]Ha ha! That's great! Now we've got
something to look forward to, hm?[.][A][Clear]
Oh, we'd better get back to the battle.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Aw[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove] All right, Amelia. But[.]
let's talk some more again.[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Oh, you bet![A]
I'm really glad I[.]
met you, Neimi.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]Me too, Amelia.[.][A]
[0CD5]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x10A][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x119][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Amelia, can I ask you a question?[.]
Why did you become a soldier?[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]Hm? Well[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove] It's[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
I wanted[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]to become strong.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Strong? What do you mean?[.][A][OpenMidRight]All my life, I've felt helpless, like[.]
I needed someone to defend me.[A]
I didn't want to feel like that anymore.[A]
[ToggleSmile]But what about you, Neimi?
What are you fighting for?[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]I'm not really sure how I wound up
getting involved in this whole war.[.][A]
[ToggleSmile]It just[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]sorta turned out
that way, you know?[.][A][ToggleSmile][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]It doesn't matter how you wound up here.
Your skill with the bow is amazing, Neimi.[A]
I'm not sure how to put this, but[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
You seem more battle ready than most
of the trained soldiers I've met.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Hmm mm mm[.][ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]Thanks. My grandpa
taught me everything I know.[A][OpenMidRight]Really?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]We used to go hunting together
when I was little[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
Oh! That reminds me![A]
I used to have a pet fox, a little
kit I found out hunting one day.[A][OpenMidRight]Wow! A fox kit?[.][A]
I've never seen one before.[.]
Was it cute?[A][OpenMidLeft]He was adorable! So small, and he had[.]
such soft and fluffy fur.[.][A]
It was so cute watching him try to run
his fastest on those short little legs.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Tee hee.[A][OpenMidLeft]What about you? Did you[.]
ever have any pets?[.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Me? Well, I don't--[.]
Oh![.][A]
[ToggleSmile]I did! I used to have[.]
a little pet bird.[A][OpenMidLeft]Oh, what kind?[A][OpenMidRight]Hm. Well, she had beautiful[.]
feathers, I remember that.[A]
They were all blue and yellow and[.]
orange. She used to sing to me.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]She was a songbird? That sounds nice.[.][A][OpenMidRight]It was. Whenever I felt lonely, she[.]
would sing her song to cheer me up.[.][A]
I let her go when I left my village[.]
and joined Grado's army.[A][OpenMidLeft]That's so sad[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
I think I'd like to get another[.]
pet when this war is all over.[A][OpenMidRight]Really?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Definitely. You should get one, too.
Once this war is over, I mean.[A]
When everything is at peace again,
we should each get a pet.[.][A][OpenMidRight][MoveMidRight][OpenMidRight]That sounds great! And then we can
have our pets visit one another.[A][OpenMidLeft]I'd like that.[A][OpenMidRight]Me, too.[A]
[0CD6]
[ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x119][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x10A][OpenMidLeft]I just noticed something, Neimi.[A]
There are a lot of female soldiers
traveling with us, aren't there?[A][OpenMidRight]You know, you're right![.][A][OpenMidLeft]It's nice to see. It wasn't like
that in Grado's army.[.][A]
It makes me feel much more at ease.[.][A][OpenMidRight]I was really nervous when I started up, but[.]
then I spoke more with the princess[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]I've started noticing that some of the
women are getting[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]friendly with the men.[A]
I thought it was, you know, just the
camaraderie of the field or whatever.[.][A]
But I'm starting to think that's not
the case, if you know what I mean.[A]
[ToggleSmile]I'm starting to think maybe[.]
it's something else entirely.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]Hee hee hee[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
So, um[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove] Is there any boy you like?[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Hm? Why do you ask? Or[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]is it[.]
that you have someone YOU like?[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I do.[.][A]
He's someone who's always watched[.]
over me, stood by my side.[A]
He used to make me cry, but[.]
I[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]I love him.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]That's amazing! You know, I'm[.]
a little jealous of you[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
Have you told him how you feel?[.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Uh-uh[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Well, you have to tell him! I'm[.]
sure he likes you, too, Neimi.[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I will. Someday.[.....]
[ToggleSmile]Not today. But someday, I will.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]There you go.[.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]But you never answered my question![.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft][MoveMidLeft][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]What, me?[.]
I[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]er[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
I honestly never really spoke to
any of the men in Grado's army.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]But you're not in Grado's army
anymore! What about now?[A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Huh?
Oh, er, well[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft][HalfCloseEyes][OpenMidLeft]I'm[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]not so sure[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]Ha! You do, don't you![A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Uh[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]Mm-hm[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]Don't worry. I'm sure he
likes you, Amelia.[A][OpenMidLeft][OpenEyes][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Why do you say that?[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]Well, you're so[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove] You're so
cute, and you're so nice.[.][A]
How could anyone NOT like you?[A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Neimi[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[ToggleSmile]Thanks. That's really sweet of you.[.]
I'm happy to hear you say that![.][A][OpenMidRight]Be sure you tell him how you feel![A][OpenMidLeft]You, too! I'm not the[.]
only one suffering here![A][OpenMidRight]Hee hee hee. All right.[.]

[OpenQuote]Brother[CloseQuote] is too formal.[A][OpenMidLeft]Oh[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
All right, Artur it is.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Very good.
[ToggleSmile]Ack![A][ToggleSmile][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]What is it?[.][.....]
What's wrong?[.][A][OpenMidRight]Oh, nothing. Sorry.[.][A]
But[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]that hand mirror
hanging from your waist[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Oh, this?[.]
It's a keepsake from my mother.[.][A]
I had it stolen from me once, so
I've made this leather strap for it.[A]
I can tie it to my belt and take it[.]
with me everywhere now.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]It's[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove] Excuse me, but may[.]
I look at it for a moment?[A][CloseSpeechSlow][OpenMidRight][MoveRight][OpenRight]Hm[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][.......]
Yes, well, that is interesting.[.][A][Clear]
If my memory serves, this is quite
a valuable mirror.[A]
It is a gift given only to clerics
of the highest order.[.][A]
Few of these mirrors exist, and for[.]
you to have one means your mother[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yes, she was a cleric[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
[ToggleSmile]When I was young, an illness[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenRight]Say no more. I understand.[A]
[ToggleSmile]But seeing you and the mirror[.]
she left you tells me something.[A]
Your mother was a good person,
benevolent, faithful, and caring.[.][A]
And you are the product of her
care, filled with the same light.[.][A][ToggleSmile][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Thank you[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove] It makes me
happy to hear that.[.][A][OpenRight]I'm delighted to have met you.

with you again so soon![.][A][OpenMidRight]Oh! Artur![A]
Yes, I'm happy to see you.[A][OpenMidLeft]That's an impressive bow. Am I to[.]
understand that you're an archer?[.][A]
I've heard the others speak highly
of your skills.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Thank you. And I was watching you use[.]
your magic. It was pretty incredible![.][A][OpenMidLeft]Oh, it was nothing. I'm just a novice.[.....]

What am I going to do?[A][OpenMidLeft][MoveMidLeft][OpenMidLeft]Lost!?[.....] How could that happen!?[A]
That mirror is a precious artifact,[.]
not to mention an important keepsake![.][A][.....][OpenMidRight]The leather strap[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
It's torn[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight][HalfCloseEyes][OpenMidRight][Clear]Ohhhh[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove] Sniff[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
Waaaaaaah![A][OpenMidRight][CloseEyes][OpenMidLeft][MoveMidLeft][OpenMidLeft]Oh, don't--[.][A][CloseSpeechSlow][OpenMidLeft][MoveLeft][....][OpenLeft]Please don't cry.[.][A]
Don't worry. We'll
look for it together.[.][A][OpenMidRight][HalfCloseEyes][OpenMidRight]Sniff[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenLeft]Any idea when you lost it?[A][OpenMidRight]I think I[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]sniff[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]had it with[.]
me when the battle started.[.][A]
It was[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]right there on
my belt[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove] Sniff[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenLeft]Then it must be around here[.]
somewhere, right?[.][A]
I'll go look over here. You[.]
check the ground back there.[A][OpenMidRight]All[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove] All right[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][ClearFace][OpenFarFarLeft][LoadFace][0x11A][OpenFarFarRight][LoadFace][0x10A][OpenFarFarRight][HalfCloseEyes][OpenFarFarLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A][......][OpenFarFarRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A][.......][CloseSpeechSlow][OpenFarFarLeft][MoveLeft][OpenFarFarRight][MoveRight][OpenLeft]I couldn't find it here[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
Any luck there?[.][A][OpenRight][CloseEyes][OpenRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]Sob[.][ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]Sniff[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
I can't[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]find it[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenLeft]Don't worry. It has to be[.]
around somewhere.[.][A]
Just keep looking. I'll[.]
ask the others, too.[A][OpenRight][HalfCloseEyes][OpenRight]All right[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove] I'll just
go look over here[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenRight][ClearFace][OpenLeft]Oh, Neimi[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
Sigh[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][Clear]
How am I ever going to find it
in the middle of a battlefield?[.][A]
I suppose I simply must have
faith. Yes, that's it.[A]
Faith will guide me to her
mother's mirror.[A]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x10A][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x11A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Neimi![A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Artur[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Look, I found it![.][A]
Here[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Oh[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I've been asking around since[.]
the last time we spoke.[.][A]
I found out that our convoy master had
found a mirror lying on the ground.[.][A]
When I asked to see it, imagine my
delight when I saw it was your mirror![A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft][HalfCloseEyes][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]Sniff[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove] I'm so[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
so happy![.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
You know, when I was looking for
your mirror, I was reminded[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
I had a similar experience when I was[.]
young. It's why I chose to be a monk.[.][A][OpenMidLeft][OpenEyes][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]What happened?[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]One day, when I was just a little boy,
I had lost a toy, and I was crying.[.][A]
[ToggleSmile]I lived near a monastery, and one of
the monks saw me sitting there weeping.[.][A]
He spent his day trying to find out why[.]
I was so sad and to cheer me up.[A]
It was so trivial--that toy was nothing[.]
but a trinket, but to me, it had value.[.][A]
I later found out a friend of mine
had taken it without asking, but[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
Anyway, I was very happy that someone[.]
had stopped to show so much concern.[A]
To everyone else, I was just a petty
child weeping over a toy.[.][A]
To this monk, however, I was a sad and
lost soul, crying out in need.[A]
He was so kind, and he spent so much
of his day on a child's tears.[A]
I admired his attitude, even then.[A]
It was then that I realized that I could
honor his deed by becoming a monk.[A][OpenMidLeft]And[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]that's why[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]Yes, that's why.[A]
[ToggleSmile]Oh! Your mirror![A][ToggleSmile][CloseSpeechSlow][OpenMidRight][MoveRight][OpenRight]Here you go.[A][OpenMidLeft]Oh[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][CloseSpeechSlow][OpenMidLeft][MoveLeft][OpenLeft][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
I'm[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]really happy[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenRight]Ah. Just as I thought.[A][OpenLeft][ToggleSmile]What?[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenRight]Your smile is delightful. It's a
vast improvement on those tears.[A]
The heavens themselves must have
wanted to see that smile[A]
and conspired to help me find[.]
your mirror.[A][OpenLeft]Thank you, Artur[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
I'm so grateful.[A][OpenRight]No, Neimi.[A]
I'm grateful to you. Talking to you[.]
makes me feel at peace.[.][A]
I feel like[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]some of the others make[.]
light of me from time to time.[A][OpenLeft]Oh, that's only[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove] It's just because
you're so honest and pure of heart.[.][A]
Someone I know[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]teases me a lot,
too. All the time, he teases me.[A][OpenRight][ToggleSmile]I see[.][ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]I'm sorry to hear that.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenLeft]Well, it's not that he's all bad.[.]
He can be very kind, but[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
But you're kind, too, Artur.[A][OpenRight]Thank you.[A]
You know, when you meet someone, that[.]
person reflects back at you[.][A]
like a mirror, revealing within them
the emotions that you project.[A]
Angry people bring out the anger within[.]
others, just as sullen, hopeless people[.][A]
bring out nothing but the sorrow within[.]
all those to whom they speak.[.][A]
Do you know why so many people seem[.]
kind to you, Neimi?[.][A]
It is because you yourself are a kind[.]
person. You bring that out in others.[.][A][OpenLeft]Oh, Artur[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove] That's so kind--[.]
I mean[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove] Er[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove] Thank you.[.][A][OpenRight]Please, Neimi, always hold that[.]
kindness close to your heart.[.][A][OpenLeft]I will[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[0CDA]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x110][OpenMidLeft]Hm[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove] I wonder if[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][.....]
Oh, I see[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][......][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x11A][OpenMidRight]What are you doing, Lute?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Oh![.][A]
I was just observing this[.]
chemida beetle.[.][A][OpenMidRight]You haven't changed at
all, have you, Lute?[A][OpenMidLeft]What do you mean?[.][A][OpenMidRight]You spent most of your time sequestered[.]
in your room, studying your books.[A]
On the rare occasion you went outside,
you were paralyzed with fascination.[A][OpenMidLeft]Of course! There are so many fascinating
things to be learned from nature![.][A]
There are a great many books out there,[.]
and I have read most of them, of course.[A]
But I've found that what is written can[.]
differ greatly from how things truly are.[.][A]
Take this chemida beetle, for example.[A]
I've been reading from [OpenQuote]The Glossary
of Falibrian Entomology[CloseQuote] lately.[A]
According to the glossary, their wings
fall off once they reach maturity.[A]
However, I have just found an adult[.]
beetle whose wings still work perfectly![A]
Exceptions do exist to the rules my[.]
books outline. This is a rare specimen.[.][A]
I wonder, should we take it back with us?[.][A][OpenMidRight]Sigh[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[ToggleSmile]I hope this isn't another[.]
of your pranks.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]My[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]pranks?[.][A][OpenMidRight]Do you remember when I loaned[.]
you my copy of [OpenQuote]Lux Aeterna[CloseQuote]?[.][A]
You replaced my bookmark with[.]
the tail of a sedgel lizard.[A]
You scared ten years off my[.]
life, I swear it![.][A][OpenMidLeft]Did I do that?[A][OpenMidRight]And! Knowing full well that I[.]
have a[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]mild[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]fear of spiders,[A]
you caught a small army of them[.]
and unleashed them in my room![A][OpenMidLeft]I thought that if I immersed
you in the thing you feared,[A]
maybe you might be able to
overcome your fear entirely![A]
And I went to a lot of trouble
trying to catch those spiders![A][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]Why would you do that?[A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Well, I did get a bit of a kick[.]
out of the experience myself.[.][A]
Why? Did it bother you?[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]YES![.....] [.][ToggleSmile]Oh, don't worry about it.[.][A]
At least you did it because[.]
you cared about me, right?[A]
I'll just accept it as the best gesture[.]
of kindness you can manage, Lute.[.][A][ToggleSmile]
[0CDB]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x110][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x11A][OpenMidLeft]Are you tired, Artur?[.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Huh[.][ToggleMouthMove]...?[ToggleMouthMove] Oh, no, I'm[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
[ToggleSmile][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
You're right.[.]
[ToggleSmile]I am tired.[.][A]
How could you tell, Lute?[.][A]
I was trying my best
not to show it.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Oh, come on! There's no one better
than me at spotting things like this![.][A]
I can tell, you're mentally exhausted.[A][OpenMidRight]I don't know what I expected, but[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
I had no idea war would be like this.[.][A]
One battle after another, overwhelming
odds[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]and monsters!?[A]
In this day and age, we're fighting[.]
monsters from the legends and epics?[A]
I know how much is at stake, but
sometimes[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]I get so tired.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]When you're tired, there's nothing better[.]
than a good meal and a long sleep.[A]
And if you look at page 990 of [OpenQuote]De
Floris Mysticis,[CloseQuote] there's a special[.][A]
herb that, once decocted into a potion,[.]
will help relax your muscles.[.][A]
Look for the parfina flower, and reduce[.]
it into a thick syrup before drinking.[A]
Oh, and I hear music helps you sleep.[.]
If you like, I can hum something for you.[.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Thank you.[A]
However, I think I'll pass on your offer,[.]
delightful though your humming must be.[.][A]
You must be tired as well. Take care
of yourself, and rest when you can.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]I will.[.][A]
In fact, maybe I'll just
hum to myself instead.[A]
Will you be all right?[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I'm fine. I feel quite
refreshed, in fact.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Refreshed?[.....] How so?
Was it some new kind of magic?[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Perhaps, from a certain point of view.[A]
Your every word has nurtured my soul[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Hm.[.][A]
I'm not sure I get it, but as[.]
long as you're feeling better![A]
[0CDC]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x110][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x11A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Hello, Lute.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]What is it? You look like you[.]
have something on your mind.[A][OpenMidLeft]Oh.[.][.....][A]
No. I was just thinking[.]
about monsters.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Monsters?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Yes.[A]
All these monsters are our enemies, I know,[.]
but[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]they're not all bad, are they?[A][OpenMidRight]What are you talking about?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]They're kind of cute, don't you think?
I mean, like those revenants, for example.[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]It's fair to say I will never[.]
understand your tastes.[.][A]
Besides, I thought you enjoyed
using them as, well, magic practice.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Oh, I do. I do indeed.[A]
I use my magic to rip them to[.]
shreds[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]with love, of course.[.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Your way of expressing love[.]
is somewhat frightening[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Do you think so?
Thank you.[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]No[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove] That wasn't a compliment.[A]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
Should I, ah, expect you to[.]
attack me with magic, too?[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Hm?[.][A]
Why would I attack you
with my magic?[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]You don't get it?[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]No.[.][A]
Your strange logic baffles even[.]
my brilliant, brilliant mind.[.][A]
That's why I'm curious.[.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Really? You don't get it?[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]No, I don't![A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]You really don't?[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Stop that![A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I'm just giving you a hard
time, Lute.[.][A]
All right. I'll just come straight
out and say it.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Finally![A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]It's because I like you.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft][MoveMidLeft][OpenMidLeft]What!?[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]In fact, I love you, and I'm
hoping perhaps that you love me.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft][MoveMidLeft][OpenMidLeft]Oh![.][A][OpenMidLeft][MoveMidLeft][OpenMidLeft]Oh!!![.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Now, do you understand?[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Er[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][.....] Um[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][.....] A-according to [OpenQuote]A Young
Girl's Primer to Nazonian Magic,[CloseQuote][.][A]
that most ancient tome long sought by, er,
the terrible Demon King himself[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
it's not uncommon for a party to
assign feelings of[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]er, love[A]
to the reanimated hordes they[.]
confront on the battlefield,[A]
and considering my incredible brain[.]
and the remarkable skills I--[.][A][OpenMidRight]Lute?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Well, that is[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
What I mean is[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]What's wrong with you? I don't
often see you lose your cool.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Th-that's because[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes?[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft][HalfCloseEyes][OpenMidLeft]Well[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
My books don't tell me anything[.]
about how to deal with love![A]
So[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Heh[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove] Heh heh heh[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][......]
Ha ha ha ha!!![A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft][CloseEyes][OpenMidLeft]I'm sorry. I'm a little out of
my depth when it comes to love.[.][A][OpenMidRight]No, you're not.[.]
Love needs no textbooks.[A]
Just be yourself, and listen
to your feelings.[.][A][OpenMidLeft][OpenEyes][OpenMidLeft]Is[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]that all I need to do?[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I promise.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][.....]

Are you talking to me?[A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yes, that's right. Come here
for a moment. I won't bite.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenFarFarRight][MoveMidRight][OpenMidRight]How may I help you, my lady?[A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Would you spin yourself[.]

Like[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]Like this?[A][CloseSpeechSlow][....][OpenMidRight][MoveMidRight][.......][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Hm[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove] Not bad. Not bad at all.[.]
You have a graceful form.[.][A]
And you're quite beautiful.[.][A]
It'd be a waste to let you
stay a simple clergyman.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]Beautiful? Me?
Do you really think so?[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yes, you have a lovely face.[A]
Say[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove] Would you like to dance with[.]
me? I think you have the potential.[.][A]
I could use a partner. When this
war ends, I think it should be you.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]I[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]don't know about that.
Dancing probably isn't my thing.[A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]You never know until you try.[.][A]
Anyway, from what I can see, I
think you've got what it takes.[.][A]
Trust me. There's no future in
this church business. Be a dancer.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]I'm afraid I have to disagree.
I feel this is my calling, you see.[.][A]
Er[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove] If that's all you wanted,
would you excuse me?[A][OpenMidLeft]Oh, oh. Yes, fine. Only[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
[ToggleSmile]What's your name, child?[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]I'm A-Artur.[A][OpenMidLeft]I'm Tethys. I'm a dancer.[.]
Don't forget.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Hm?[.]
T-Tethys?[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]That's right. I'll see
you later, child.[.][A]
Think about what I told you about[.]
becoming a dancer, won't you?[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]I really don't think it's for me[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]

attention, as you'll be going next.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Tethys, we're in the middle of a
battle. Can't this wait until later?[A][OpenMidRight]My, aren't we confident! No, we[.]
can't have that. We have to practice.[.][A]
I refuse to have a partner who's
too lazy to practice daily.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]No, you're not following me. I'm
not your partner. I don't want to--[.][A]
Would you please stop calling me
[OpenQuote]child[CloseQuote] in front of everyone![.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]What's wrong with looking young?[A][Clear]
After all, you have such lovely[.]
skin. May I[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]touch your cheeks?[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight][MoveLeft][OpenMidLeft][MoveFarLeft][OpenFarLeft]Oh[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove] Ah, normally, people wait for
an answer before they start[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]er[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
well, touching me.
Um[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove] Would you please stop?[.][A][OpenLeft][ToggleSmile]Amazing! It's like velvet to the touch![.]
You have such smooth skin![A][ToggleSmile][OpenFarLeft][HalfCloseEyes][OpenFarLeft]Er[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]Excuse me[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]

Oh[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove] You meant my skin. Well, I just
rub manon leaves on after I wash.[.][A][OpenLeft][MoveRight][OpenRight]Manon leaves? Those scratchy things?[A]
I always thought they would just leave
a rash. Hm. Maybe I should try[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[ToggleSmile]I'll see you later, child.[A]
I'll be checking up on your progress,[.]
so be sure to practice those steps.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenRight][ClearFace][OpenFarLeft][OpenEyes][OpenFarLeft][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]Huh?[A][OpenFarLeft][MoveMidLeft][OpenMidLeft]But[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove] But I don't want to
be a dancer[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]

You must be practicing a lot, hm? Well,[.]
show me what you've got![A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Please! I have a name! I am not[.]
a child! My name is Artur![A]
And[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]I really must protest about[.]
becoming a dancer.[A]
I have no interest in learning
how to dance, do you understand?[A][OpenFarRight][MoveFarRight][OpenFarRight]I'm glad you're here, because I have
something I wanted to tell you.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Y-you do?[.][A][OpenFarRight]I scrubbed my face with manon leaves,[.]
just like you said, but look[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
I got a rash, just like I thought[.]
I would. Look here, on my cheek.[A][OpenMidLeft]Uh[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove] Maybe you scrubbed[.]
too hard?[.][A][OpenFarRight]Well, here[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove] Take a look.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]I'm not sure this is the right time.
We're in the middle of a battle.[A][OpenFarRight][ToggleSmile]We'll be fine. It'll only take a
second. We'll be done in a flash.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Fine, fine[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove] But let's be quick.[A][OpenMidLeft][MoveRight][SendToBack][OpenFarRight][ToggleSmile]Come on, you're not looking right.
Get closer. Closer[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]More.[.][A]
Look right around here[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
See? It's red, isn't it?[A][ToggleSmile][OpenRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]A little, but[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]it's not that bad.[A][CloseSpeechSlow][OpenFarRight][MoveMidRight][OpenRight]Whoa!![A][CloseSpeechSlow][OpenRight][MoveRight][OpenRight][MoveLeft][OpenLeft]I-if you turn your head so suddenly[.]

It's so close to my[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Hm mm mm. You're blushing.
Are you all right, child?[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenLeft]I-I'm fine, but[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
Every time you're around, my heart[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Starts thumping?[A][ToggleSmile][OpenLeft]Y-yes[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]To tell you the truth, you look[.]
just like my first love.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenLeft]Is[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove] Is that so?[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]But he moved, and I never saw him again.
Oh, it brings back such memories[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
He and I couldn't have been much
older than, say, ten.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenLeft][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]Are you telling me I look[.]

Who would that be?[A][ToggleSmile][OpenLeft][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]My mother.[A]
She called me [OpenQuote]child[CloseQuote] when I was
little, just like you do now.[.][A]
I used to like that then, but[.]
now that I'm older[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]Oh[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][.....]
A bit of a mama's boy, are you, Artur?[A][ToggleSmile][OpenLeft]Excuse me?[.....] Mama's boy?[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Tee-hee[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
Very well. I shall mother you.
Call me [OpenQuote]mom,[CloseQuote] child.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenLeft][ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]Er[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]I[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
I'm not sure about this.[A]
Besides, I used to call her[.]
[OpenQuote]mother,[CloseQuote] not [OpenQuote]mom,[CloseQuote] so[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I'm only kidding. I just
love teasing you.[.][A]
However, I am serious about you[.]
becoming a dancer.[A]
Your good looks and graceful movement[.]
tell me you have the talent[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
You would make a fine partner.
Just think about it, will you?[A][ToggleSmile][OpenLeft]Oh, I forgot--that's what I wanted to[.]
talk to you about. I don't want to--[A][CloseSpeechSlow][OpenMidRight][ClearFace][OpenLeft][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]Er, excuse me. Tethys,
would you wait up for me!?[A]
[0CE0]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x113][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x11A][OpenMidRight][MoveRight][OpenRight]So this is a wyvern[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]Hey, what's going on here?
Don't get too close now.[A]
It may look calm now, but it's
got a dangerous side. Like me.[A][OpenRight][MoveRight][OpenRight][MoveMidRight][OpenMidRight]S-sorry!
Oh, the name is Artur.[A][OpenMidLeft]I'm Cormag.[.]
Nice to meet you.[.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]You, too, Sir Cormag.[.]
It's a pleasure.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]So[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove] Interested in wyverns, are you?[A][OpenMidRight]It's not so much interest as it is,[.]
well, fascination, if you will.[.][A]
The way how they fly in the sky at will[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
and their powerful limbs.[.][A]
I've seen them from a distance before,
but I've never seen one up close[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
Do you think it would mind if[.]
I were to touch it?[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Nah, go right ahead.[A]
[ToggleSmile]But wyverns can be proud. They won't
warm up to anyone they think unworthy.[A]
Took me three years before this one[.]
would let me ride on his back.[A]
Oh, he hated me at first. Always
snarling and snatching at me[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
I don't know how many times he
threw me when I tried to ride him.[A][OpenMidRight]R-really? Maybe I should
keep my distance then.[A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]No, he seems to like you.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]How do you know?[A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]He hasn't tried to eat your[.]
face yet, for one thing.[A]
Maybe he can sense your, what'd[.]
you call it, fascination?[.][A]
Yeah, maybe it won't take too[.]
long for you two to be friends.[.][A][ToggleSmile][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]Hm. Well then, it's very nice[.]
to meet you, Sir Cormag's Wyvern?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]His name's Genarog. Next time[.]
you're around, come say hi.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Thanks. I will![.][A]
[0CE1]
[ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x11A][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x113][OpenMidLeft]Sir Cormag![.][A][OpenMidRight]If it isn't Artur.
[ToggleSmile]What's the rush?[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]I've been thinking about how to[.]
become friends with Genarog.[A]
I was thinking perhaps he might[.]
like it if I gave him something.[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]You want to give Genarog a gift?[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Yes. It's an amulet made of a star stone.[.][A]
According to legend, those who carry
star stones are blessed from above.[.][A]
It's customary to wear them as amulets
in Renais, and I thought[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I see[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove] But that's your amulet,
isn't it?[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]No need to worry for me, Sir Cormag.
I pray every morning and every night.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Well, if that's the case, then we'll
take it. Look at that, Genarog![.][A]
All right, Artur, I want you to[.]
place it in his saddlebag.[A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I'm a little scared, but
[ToggleSmile]I'll give it a try![.][A][OpenMidLeft][MoveLeft][OpenLeft][ToggleSmile]All right[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove] The saddlebag[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
This one right here?[A]
[.......]There you go[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[ToggleSmile]Sir Cormag, look! Genarog[.]
licked my hand![.][A][OpenMidRight]Whoa, not bad[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
Not bad at all, Artur.[A]
I've never once seen him
lick anyone's hand but mine.[A][OpenLeft][ToggleSmile]Really?[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]Yeah, and it took him two years[.]
before he'd even do that![.][A]
You and he seem to be getting[.]
along famously, as they say.[A][OpenLeft]That makes me happy, Sir Cormag.
I'm glad he likes the amulet.[.][A][OpenMidRight]I think he likes you more than
he likes that amulet, honestly.[.][A][OpenLeft]Really, Sir Cormag?[.]
May I talk to him again?[A][OpenMidRight]Sure, anytime. We're looking
forward to it. Both of us.[A]
[0CE2]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x11A][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x113][OpenMidRight]I should apologize to[.]
you, Artur.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]What's wrong, Sir Cormag?[.]
Did something happen?[.][A][OpenMidRight]The star-stone amulet that you
so generously gave Genarog[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
It got shattered when an
archer attacked us.[.][A]
It's not all bad, though. That
stone stopped the arrow cold.[.][A]
Saved both me AND Genarog, it did.[A]
Had that amulet been not there,[.]
we wouldn't be here right now.[A][OpenMidLeft]That's unfortunate, but[.]
[ToggleSmile]I'm glad the amulet worked![.][A]
I'll have to make a prayer of[.]
thanks for the stone's protection.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Well, we owe you, Artur.[A]
[ToggleSmile]And it's not exactly a
perfect trade, but[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove] Here.[A][OpenMidLeft]What's this?[A]
[CloseSpeechSlow][OpenMidLeft][MoveLeft][......][OpenLeft]This[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove] This looks like
a wyvern stone![.][A][OpenMidRight]A wyvern stone? Are they rare?[A][OpenLeft]Yes, very! Where on earth[.]
did you[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Genarog had it.[.][A]
I didn't have any idea what it was.[.][A]
I figured maybe you'd know something
about it.[.][A]
And it looks like I was right,
wasn't I? You know what it's worth?[.][A]
Well, like I said, it's yours.
Keep it.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenLeft]A-are you sure!?[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Sure. You don't mind, now,
do you, Genarog?[A][ToggleSmile][ToggleSmile][OpenLeft]Th-thank you[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
I mean it[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
Sir Cormag, Genarog[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
Wyvern stones are like dragonstones,
only far more rare. Mages covet them.[.][A]
Having one focuses your powers,[.]
refines your magical control.[.][A]
But nobody knows where they come
from or how to craft them.[A]
There are no more than a handful of[.]
wyvern stones in the world today.[.][A]
I never thought I'd even see one,[.]
much less hold one in my hands.[.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]So it's a big deal, eh?[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenLeft]It most certainly is, Sir Cormag.[.]
Genarog[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove] I can't thank you enough.[A]
You've made one of my dreams
come true.[A][OpenMidRight]I'm glad we were able to
help you, Artur.[A][OpenLeft]I'll cherish this wyvern stone always.[A][CloseSpeechSlow][......][ToggleSmile][OpenLeft][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]By the way, Sir Cormag,[.][A]
[ToggleSmile]do you have a dream?[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]My dream. Hmph[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][.....][A]
My only dream right now is to undo
the damage Grado has done.[A]
I want Grado to be a peaceful nation
again, ruled by a gentle man.[.][A][OpenLeft][ToggleSmile]I'm sure you'll see your own
dream realized, Sir Cormag.[.][A]
After all, we're all fighting[.]
to make that dream come true.[.][A]
You and Genarog have made my
own dream a reality.[A]
And you know that I'll do what
I can to make yours real, too.[A][ToggleSmile][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]Genarog was right. You are
a good lad, Artur.[A]
Tell you what. If we do restore[.]
peace, you must visit my homeland.[A]
And when you do, I think Genarog
would like to take you flying.[A][OpenLeft]I'd love to, Sir Cormag. I look forward[.]
to visiting Grado in better times.[A]
[0CE3]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x12A][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x11A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Hey, you there.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]Yes?[A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]You a monk or something?[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]Yes. I came from Renais.
My name is Artur.[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I'm Joshua.[.][A]
So, uh[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove] You want to
make me a bet?[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]A bet?[A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Sure! Call it in the air:[.]
heads or tails?[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...?[ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]What's the matter? All you have to do is
say heads or tails. So what's your call?[A][OpenMidRight]I have no idea what this is[.]
about, but I'll say heads for now.[A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Right, so I get tails.
Here, we'll flip now.[.][A]
Annnnnnd[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft][MoveMidLeft][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Right!
Tails. I win.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]You win. Um[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove] What[.]
do you win?[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Well, now, you have to
do whatever I tell you.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight][MoveMidRight][OpenMidRight]What? Why do you say that?[A][OpenMidLeft]You lost, right?[A]
[ToggleSmile]Since you lost, you've got
to do what I tell you.[A]
So when this battle's over,[.]
I want you to train with me.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]Train? What are you talking about?[A]
Look, I only said heads because[.]
you pressed me to![A]
I don't remember you saying anything
about what we were betting on.[A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]You shouldn't worry so much[.]
about the tiny details![.][A]
You'll waste your life, worrying
so much! Now, about that training.[A][Clear]
I always have a tough time fighting[.]
against people who use magic.[.][A]
I think it's got something to[.]
do with getting the timing right[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
I don't really need to polish my
technique too much.[.][A]
However, I've noticed that these
battles just keep getting harder.[.][A]
So, I figured I should train with[.]
someone who can use a little magic![.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]I commend your attitude, but
I really can't help you[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
My evenings are pretty full[.]
as it is, so[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Hey, now! A deal's a deal. I'll[.]
be waiting, so don't be late![.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]Fine[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][.....]
But just for a little while![A]
[0CE4]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x11A][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x12A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Hey, Artur.[.][A]
I wanted to thank you for training.[.]
I learned a lot from it.[A]
I hope you're not too exhausted[.]
for today's training session.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Well, actually[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
Could we not do this today?[.][A][OpenMidRight]Hey, now. Show a little[.]
enthusiasm, why don't you?[A]
[ToggleSmile]An attitude like that ain't[.]
gonna win you any battles![A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]You may be right, but I just
can't keep up with you.[.][A]
If you keep exhausting me in
training, I'll be no good[.][A]
when the real fighting begins.[A]
I'm trying not to let it show,
but I'm really worn out today.[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Then let's make a bet.
If I win, you do what I tell you.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Joshua, I'm quite drained, and
we still have much fighting to do.[A]
You should just rest tonight.[.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Don't worry about me, Artur.
So, heads or tails?[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Fine[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove] Heads.[.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Great! You're heads, and
I'm tails. Here we go![A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight][MoveMidRight][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Incredible![.][.....]
Tails! I win again![.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][.....]
Could I see that coin?[A][OpenMidRight]What for? Are you suggesting
that I would actually cheat?[A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]No. Sorry.[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]So it's a deal. I'll be waiting[.]
for you tonight. Don't forget![A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Fine[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidRight][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x12A][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]You're hopeless.
Don't look so tired.[A]
It gets me all worried, and I can't go
back to the front being all worried.[A]
[ToggleSmile]Listen, just take a day off.
Get some rest, all right?[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]But I lost the bet.[.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]The deal was, if I win,[.]
you do what I tell you.[.][A]
And what I'm telling you
to do is take it easy.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Joshua[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
[ToggleSmile]I appreciate it.[A]
I've never done much fighting.
I think I'm just worn out.[A]
It's exhausting, having to keep[.]
your guard up all the time.[.][A]
But your kindness has rejuvenated[.]
my frazzled nerves a little.[A][ToggleSmile][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]Well, we're still fighting, so
don't let your guard down.[A]
Stick close to me today, and
I'll watch over you.[A]
But don't skip tomorrow's training![.][A][OpenMidLeft]I'll be there.[A]
[0CE5]
[ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x11A][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x12A][OpenMidRight]Hey, Artur! You're looking pretty[.]
pleased with yourself today.[A]
Care to make a bet?[.][A]
If I win, we'll hit the training
again tonight.[A][OpenMidLeft]No need for bets, Joshua.[.]
I'll be happy to train with you.[A][OpenMidRight]You're volunteering?[A]
Are you feeling all right? Did
you take a blow to the head?[A][OpenMidLeft]No, no. I'm fine. I'm just
offering to help you out.[.][A]
It's easier than losing[.]
another bet to you.[.][A][OpenMidRight]What do you mean? You've
got even odds of winning.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]You must be joking![.][A]
Out of the past 21 coin flips,
I've won two, and you've won 19![A]
Those are impossible odds to beat,
so there's only one answer.[.][A]
You must have some divine[.]
betting power or something.[.][A]
If I can help you train, I will,
but I don't want to lose anymore.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]Hmph[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
But that's no fun![A]
All right, you don't have to train
with me if you don't want to bet.[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]Excuse me?[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I don't have any divine power.[A]
You've won 11 out of 21 coin tosses[.]
so far. We're about even.[.][A]
I was[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]cheating. Just
a little, though.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]You cheated? I felt so guilty[.]
when I accused you earlier.[.][A]
I guess I just trusted--[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yep. That's your problem.[.][A]
I know trust and faith are
important to you monkly types.[A]
However, on the battlefield,
you can never trust your foe.[.][A]
If we were gambling for your
life, and not for training,[.][A]
you'd be dead 19 times over.[A]
Well, I mean, you can only die
once, but you get my drift.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][.....]
I'm speechless[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Ha ha ha. Good thing I'm
a reasonably fair man, huh?[.][A]
No harm done, and you even learned
a little something, didn't you?[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]I suppose.[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]So here's the deal. I want
you to keep being my partner.[.][A]
But this time, I'll be teaching[.]
you a little bit about wagers.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]What's more important to you, Joshua?[.][.....]
Gambling or training?[.][A]
[ToggleSmile]I guess I don't even have to ask
you that, huh? But no more cheating![A][ToggleSmile]
[0CE6]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x129][OpenMidRight][MoveMidLeft][.....][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x110][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]Er[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]Er, excuse me[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
If at all possible, uh[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]would you[.]
mind not stalking me like that?[.][A][OpenMidRight]You noticed, huh?[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x129][OpenMidLeft]What did you expect?[A]
You've been at my back for days.
I can't help but notice![A]
What do you want from me?[.][A][OpenMidRight][MoveRight][OpenRight][MoveRight][OpenRight]Aaagh![A][OpenMidLeft][MoveMidLeft][OpenMidLeft][MoveFarLeft][OpenFarLeft]Hey![.....]
What was that for?[A][OpenRight][MoveMidRight][OpenMidRight]You dodged, huh?[A]
I knew your presence would
be dangerous to me.[.][A][OpenFarLeft]Hm?[.][.....]
What do you mean by[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][CloseSpeechSlow][OpenFarLeft][MoveMidLeft][.....][OpenMidRight][MoveRight][OpenRight][MoveRight][OpenRight]Gah![A][OpenMidLeft][MoveMidLeft][OpenMidLeft][MoveFarLeft][OpenFarLeft]Stop![.][.....]
P-please! Stop![.][A][OpenRight][MoveMidRight][OpenMidRight]You did it again.[.][A]
Hm. This isn't good. Nobody[.]
else has dodged me twice.[.][A][OpenFarLeft]Wh-what are you saying--[A][OpenFarLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidRight]You're quick at escaping, too.[A]
You're dangerous.[.][A]
I'm afraid I can't let you
threaten my natural superiority.[A]
[0CE7]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x129][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x110][OpenMidLeft]You must be[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]You must be Knoll.[A]
I've been researching you.[A]
I also plan to find out your
Achilles' heel before too long.[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]Why would you do something like that?[.][A][OpenMidRight]Because there's no one better than me.[A][OpenMidLeft]I'm sorry?[A][OpenMidRight]I said there's no one better than me.[.]
And if there is, I have to stop him.[A]
I can't have you threatening my[.]
natural superiority here.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Threatening your--[A][OpenMidRight]I've seen you. You use magic, and[.]
that makes you competition.[.][A]
And you use dark magic, which[.]
makes you the enemy of light.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]That's a common misconception,
actually, about dark mages.[.][A]
[ToggleSmile]And besides, we're allies here.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]No, not until we make it clear
who is superior.[A][OpenMidLeft]Oh, fine[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]What, you think you're better than me?[A][OpenMidLeft]I never said that![A]
Look, we're on the same side here.
Does it matter who's better?[A][OpenMidRight]Matter? Of course it matters! How[.]
could you possibly think it doesn't?[A]
Personally, I think I'm clearly[.]
superior to you. Don't you agree?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Do what you like.[.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
That was close. You were
trying to trick me, huh?[A]
That's dirty pool.[A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][.....]
What I'm saying is[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]It's not safe for me here.[A]
I must retreat[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]for now.[A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[0CE8]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x129][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x110][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]Lute[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]Can I-- I just wanted to
say I'm[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]sorry.[A][OpenMidLeft]Gotten over yourself, have you?[.][A][OpenMidRight]No, but I've been watching you, and[.]
I've noticed something when you fight.[A]
Suffice it to say that I am now convinced[.]
that there's no one better than me.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]I[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]see[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]I must have miscalculated your
abilities at first.[.][A]
I don't know why I thought
you could have been better.[.][A]
Anyway, I'm sorry that I
overestimated your skills.[A]
Well, if you'll excuse me.[A][OpenMidRight][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft]You know, I think you may[.]
have missed the point.[A][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x110][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]What seems to be the problem?[.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]No, nothing.[A]
See you[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]Oh, hold on.
Lute.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Yes?[A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Why don't you stay and
chat for a moment?[A]
Now that I'm not a threat to
you, we can relax and talk.[.][A]
If you don't mind, of course[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]Hm[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove] All right.[.][A]
As long as we're in agreement[.]
about who's superior around here.[.][A]
[0CE9]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x110][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x118][OpenMidRight]Hey, you.[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
I'm sorry, were you[.]
talking to me?[A][OpenMidRight]There's nobody else[.]
here, is there?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]And who are you?[A][OpenMidRight]I beg your pardon.[A]
I should have introduced myself.
Kyle, of the Knights of Renais.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Ah, I see. And I am Lute, mage
of profound genius.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Very well, Lute.
The pleasure is mine.[.][A]
To tell you the truth, I've[.]
been looking for you.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Has someone issued a search notice?[.]
Or is there a bounty on my head?[A]
Or is this perhaps a private matter?[A][OpenMidRight]I[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]guess it would be that last one.
I have a favor to ask.[A][OpenMidLeft]What would it be?[.][A]
My requests are classified into[.]
seven categories and 25 items.[A][OpenMidRight]I don't know how it would be classified,
but[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]I want you to help us fight.[A][OpenMidLeft]Why?[A][OpenMidRight]I'm a strong believer that morale is
best served by good leadership.[.][A]
A unit of knights, all trained
by Renais's finest generals.[A]
But we're fighting no ordinary foe,[.]
and we need more diverse skills.[A]
That's where you come in.[.][A]
Because you can use magic, you
could be invaluable in helping me[.][A]
develop unique battle strategies.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]So that's what you wanted[.]
me for, is it?[A][OpenMidRight]How about it? Would you do it?[A][OpenMidLeft]Sure. Anything you say.[.]
I don't mind.[.][A][OpenMidRight]I should warn you, I spend my[.]
time on the front line.[.][A]
I ride out to meet the enemy head-
on rather than attacking from afar.[.][A]
It's a much riskier prospect than[.]
supporting from the rear guard.[.][A]
Is that going to be a problem?[A][OpenMidLeft]I have no objections.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Excellent! I appreciate your help.[A]
I expect we'll be able to generate
some stunning tactics together.[.][A]
You don't need to stay at the front[.]
the whole time.[.][A]
I'll give you a cue when to approach.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Got it.[.][A]
I'll do whatever you say.[.][A][OpenMidRight]I'm counting on you.[A][OpenMidLeft]You have nothing to worry about.
There's no one better than me![A]
[0CEA]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x118][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x110][OpenMidLeft]Lute.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Yes, sir.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]I was right about you. You've been
a great help to us all.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Well, of course I have! I told you
there's no one better than me![A][OpenMidLeft]Magic is an incredibly
powerful force, isn't it?[.][A]
Sturdy armor, tough hide, it
makes no difference to magic.[.][A]
I'm in awe of it.[.][A][OpenMidRight]You're not so bad yourself.[.]
You're an incredible fighter.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Thanks.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Have you trained a lot?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Yep.[A]
When I was young, there was a lad[.]
I hated losing to.[A]
Every day, I trained harder and[.]
harder in hopes of defeating him.[.][A][OpenMidRight]So what happened? Did you[.]
finally beat him?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Uh[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
Not as such, no. But I haven't
lost to him in a while, either.[.][A]
We're evenly matched. I think[.]
we force one another to improve.[A][OpenMidRight]I see.[A]
It's always good to have someone
against whom you measure yourself.[A]
Aren't you glad you have this[.]
personal adversary?[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Uh-huh.[.][A]
[ToggleSmile]You know, I think this is the[.]
longest conversation we've had.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Really?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Well, uh[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
Not to sound rude, but I didn't take you
as the kind to be interested in others.[.][A][OpenMidRight]No, it's not rude at all. I just[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
got a little interested in you.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]I see.[.....]
[ToggleSmile]Keep up the good work.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]Yes, sir.[.][A]
[0CEB]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x110][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x118][OpenMidRight]Hooo[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove] What a fight!
How are you holding up, Lute?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]No problem, sir.[A]
I could keep this[.]
up all day![.][A][OpenMidRight]That's good to hear.[A]
But don't push yourself[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
[ToggleSmile]You're vital to my strategy![A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Of course I am! There's no
one better than me![.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I'd have to agree. This would be
a lot harder without you along.[.][A]
[ToggleSmile]This might seem forward, but[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
What do you do when you're
not, well, fighting in wars?[A][OpenMidLeft]Me? Oh, I'm a student of magic.[.][A][OpenMidRight]I guessed that much. What I mean
is, do you have any hobbies?[A][OpenMidLeft]Hobbies?[A][OpenMidRight]That's right.[.][A]
[ToggleSmile]Take me, for example. I like to collect[.]
carved figurines of animals.[A]
I have a small collection of them back
home at Renais.[.][A]
How about you?[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Does monk-watching count?[.][A][OpenMidRight]Monk-watching?
What are you talking about?[.][A]
Maybe I should ask a different question.
Do you have any favorite foods?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Out of everything I've had, curry[.]
of dried toad is my favorite.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Er[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]right[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][.....]
Do you enjoy cooking?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]I don't cook much, but I'm
sure I'd be good at it.[.][A]
I mean, I can cook with a single
word, no fire necessary![A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Ha![.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]I'm sorry?[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Ha ha ha ha ha![.]
I never get bored talking to you.[.][A]
I can't explain it, but I find
you so refreshing![A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Really? I like talking
to you, too.[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
Lute.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Yes, sir?[.][A][OpenMidRight]Why don't you come to Renais
once the war is over?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Why not?
No objections.[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Ha! No objections? That's your
answer? Well, all right, then.[A]
Let's focus on getting through
this war first, though.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Yes, sir.[.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I'm glad to have you with us.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Me, too, sir.[.][A]
[0CEC]
[ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x111][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x12A][OpenMidRight]Hey, I've been hearing good[.]
things about you lately.[A]
Everyone's real happy you've
been helping to heal them.[A][OpenMidLeft]Really? That's nice to hear.[A]
I do what little I can, but[.]
I'm glad if I've been helpful.[A][OpenMidRight]Oh, you have been, rest assured.[A]
You don't just mend flesh. Your[.]
smile eases all our pain.[.][A]
So, I may have lost our bet[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
but everything seems to have
turned out for the best, right?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Joshua[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
I just do what I can to help and
to stay out of everyone's way.[A][OpenMidRight]I'm just saying, you've saved[.]
a lot of lives out there.[.][A]
We've got other healers, I know,
but you're more than that.[A]
You're special.[.][A]
I may be the most cynical of our
lot, but even I can see that.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Joshua[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][.....]
You're far too kind.[A][OpenMidRight]Don't be so humble.[.]
You deserve the praise.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]If[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]if you say so.[A][OpenMidRight]Well, I do. So keep it up.[A][OpenMidLeft]I'll do what I can.[.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]Nice smile.[.][A]
[0CED]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x111][OpenFarFarRight][LoadFace][0x12A][OpenMidLeft]Oh![.]
[.....][OpenMidLeft][MoveMidLeft][OpenMidLeft]Aaaaaah!!![A][OpenFarFarRight]Watch out![A][CloseSpeechSlow][OpenFarFarRight][MoveMidRight][OpenMidRight]Nngh!![A]
[OpenMidRight][MoveMidRight][.......][OpenMidRight]An arrow!? Did someone set
up a trap for us?[.][A]
Or is there someone here?[.]
An archer? Where is he?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Joshua![.][A]
[ToggleSmile]You saved me. Thank[.]
goodness you were near.[.][A][ToggleSmile][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]Yeah, well[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove] I just happened to[.]
be in the neighborhood is all.[A][OpenMidLeft]You make light of it, but I truly[.]
appreciate that you were nearby.[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Well, uh[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][.....]
Are you all right?[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]I'm fine, thank you.[A]
But it's only thanks to you,
Joshua. You saved me.[.][A]
I'll try to be more attentive[.]
to my surroundings.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Yeah, well[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove] It's not always easy, you
know? Especially when you're working.[.][A]
You concentrate pretty hard when
you're doing your healing thing.[A]
Just focus on your work, and I'll[.]
keep an eye on you. Sound fair?[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Oh, no[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove] I couldn't ask you to
spend all your time protecting me.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]What, you don't want me to?[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]It's not that at all![.]
I rather like--[.][A]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][.....]
[ToggleSmile]Um, never mind.[.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][.....]
Say, you want to make a bet?[A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Another[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][.....]bet?[A]
Right here? In the middle[.]
of this battlefield?[A]
What did you intend to
bet on this time?[.][A][ToggleSmile][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]That you're gonna fall for
me, sooner or later.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]What!?[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I'm betting yes, personally.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Oh[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove] This isn't the time for
jokes[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove] I-I just don't know.[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][.....][OpenMidRight]Hey, don't go running off![A]
[ToggleSmile]Sigh[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove] I wasn't even joking[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][ToggleSmile]
[0CEE]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x12A][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x111][OpenMidLeft]Ouch[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]Joshua, are you all right?
Do you need medical atten--[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Natasha, how did you get
here so quickly?[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][.....][A]
I just[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][ToggleSmile]happened to be
in the neighborhood.[A]
Are you hurt?[.][A][ToggleSmile][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Ugh. Yeah[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
But it's only a scratch.[A]
Still, if you could[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]take
care of it. Please?[.][A][OpenMidRight]Yes[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
[ToggleSmile][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove]
[......][ToggleSmile][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]All done.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Thanks.[.]
[ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
Say, Natasha. Want
to make a bet?[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]On what? If this is another[.]
of your little jokes, I--[.][A][ToggleSmile][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Will I make you happy?
That's what we'll bet on.[.][A]
Are you in, or what?[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]What?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]That's everything I've got.[.]
I can't up the ante any more.[.][A]
[ToggleSmile]So how about it? Are you in?[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]Are you[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]serious?[A][OpenMidLeft]Look into my eyes, and
decide for yourself.[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][.....]
I[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile][OpenQuote]I serve the people,[CloseQuote] is that it?[.][A]
Listen, does it make any difference[.]
if you serve them in Grado or Renais?[.][A]
You can come with me. It'll work
out, you'll see. I'll make it work.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]Joshua[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]Natasha.[A][OpenMidRight][CloseEyes][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[.......][.......][OpenMidRight][OpenEyes][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove]
I will[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][.....]
accept your wager.[A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]You will?[.][A][ToggleSmile][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]What I'm betting is my
future. My happiness.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Natasha[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][.....]
I can't afford to lose this one.[A][OpenMidRight]You're right[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
And I hope from the bottom
of my heart that you win.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Don't worry. In a pinch, I
never lose.[.][A]
Well, I mean, I lose sometimes.[.]
But not this time![A][OpenMidRight]At least[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]you won our last bet.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Hm? Oh! Oh, yeah[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
That you'd fall for me.[.][A][OpenMidRight][CloseEyes][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]That was easy.[A]
This bet, this is going to be a tough[.]
one. I'm gonna have to work at it.[A]
But knowing that I've won one bet[.]
already, at least I've got that.[A][OpenMidRight][OpenEyes][OpenMidRight]This war is terrible[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]but at
least it brought us together.[.][A]
[0CEF]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x111][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x129][OpenMidLeft]Master Knoll[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]I know you[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove] You're[.]
Natasha, from the temple.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Yes. I remember seeing you
many times back in Grado.[.][A]
[ToggleSmile]But this is the first time
we've ever actually spoken.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I don't know what it is, but clerics and
mages seem to be like oil and water.[A]
[ToggleSmile]And we mages can be an enigmatic bunch
at times. Shadowy and sinister[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
Or at least, that's how I've always[.]
imagined you clerics saw us.[A][OpenMidLeft]Oh, no! I never--[.][A]
Well, no. You're right. We had few
dealings with the mages.[A]
But that's in the past. I have
a question for you, Master Knoll.[.][A][OpenMidRight]I think I can guess. It's about the[.]
Sacred Stones and Prince Lyon, is it?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]It is.[A]
My mentor died[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]trying to warn us about[.]
the threat our Sacred Stone posed.[A]
I want to know the truth.[.][A]
What is Emperor Vigarde up to? What[.]
is Prince Lyon's role in this?[A][OpenMidRight]There are as many truths out there
as there are people to tell them.[.][A]
[ToggleSmile]Perhaps it's best simply to choose the
truth with which you are most comfortable.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]In the eyes of your mentor, I would[.]
imagine we must have seemed quite evil.[.][A]
He imagined our magical studies using[.]
the Sacred Stone were sacrilege.[A]
I suspect he quite loathed the
ancient magics he called [OpenQuote]dark.[CloseQuote][A][OpenMidLeft]You're wrong[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][CloseSpeechSlow][OpenMidLeft][MoveLeft][OpenLeft]My mentor wasn't like that at all![A]
And isn't this war the direct result
of all your dark magic research?[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]Hm[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove] Well, I suppose
you are right about that.[.][A]
Your magic stems from faith in the
unknowable, the divine presence.[A]
In contrast, dark magic stems from
knowledge, from understanding.[A]
We distrust what we do not understand,
and we strive to know the unknowable.[.][A]
Perhaps our disciplines truly[.]
are incompatible.[.][A][OpenLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[0CF0]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x111][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x129][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]Our researches ended in[.]
miserable failure.[A]
Grado's Sacred Stone was shattered.[.]
Prince Lyon, corrupted[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
And this whole tragedy that unfolds[.]
around us even now.[.][A]
It's true. We mages have triggered
this age's greatest calamity.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]But why? What was it all for?[.][A]
What did you hope to accomplish[.]
with the power of the Sacred Stone?[.][A][OpenMidRight]All Prince Lyon wanted was to help
people[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]and we are his servants.[A][OpenMidLeft]Help people?[A][OpenMidRight]We read of a spell entitled the time shear.[.]
It causes, in effect, a hole in time.[.][A]
This spell warps time, punches a
hole through cause and effect.[A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]We lack the knowledge to reproduce
this ancient spell today.[.][A]
Prince Lyon, however, was convinced[.]
that we could unravel its secret.[.][A]
He felt we could use it to predict--
and even prevent--future events.[A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]Prevent[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]the future?[.][A][OpenMidRight]Oh, we dedicated years to studying
this spell.[.][A]
You see, the greater the disaster, the
farther it sends ripples through time.[A]
We learned to read these ripples from[.]
the future, hoping to save lives.[.][A]
If we could know when a disaster would
strike, we could evacuate people.[.][A]
We could save millions of lives.[A][OpenMidLeft]But[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][A]
It seems so, so blasphemous.[A]
That worldly creatures should[.]
take control of fate, it--[A][ToggleMouthMove][OpenMidRight]Are you saying that, knowing the
future, we should do nothing?[.][A]
We should simply allow people to
die in order to preserve [OpenQuote]fate[CloseQuote]?[A][OpenMidLeft]I[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]I'm sorry. I don't mean to
sound hostile.[A]
Prince Lyon himself was troubled
by these same doubts, you see.[A]
But we pressed on with our studies.[.][A]
We felt it was our duty, in the[.]
interest of all Grado's people.[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]Perhaps we were bitter that we
receive no credit for aiding Grado.[.][A]
That we receive no accolades for our
research, for the benefit it brings.[A]
I do not know. But we pressed on,[.]
nonetheless.[A]
The misconceptions linking the ancient
magics to [OpenQuote]evil[CloseQuote] die hard and slow.[.][A]
Prince Lyon sought to change that.[A]
He wanted, as we all wanted, to[.]
prove that our magic had good uses.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Prince Lyon would never--[.][A][OpenMidRight]With our aid, Prince Lyon predicted[.]
a great storm rising in the south.[A]
He barred ships from leaving port,
and, oh, how the people complained.[.][A]
But the storm came, and the seas
raged. We saved countless lives.[A]
And Prince Lyon cared not at all
if the people loved him for it.[.][A]
He only wanted them to be safe.[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]And now, I see it all so clearly.[.]
All our research amounts to nothing.[A]
All I can do now is lament our
hunger for knowledge. Our greed.[A]
[0CF1]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x111][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x129][OpenMidLeft]Master Knoll[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]Still have questions, do you?[.]
I have told you all that I know.[A][OpenMidLeft]I'm not sure you did.[.][A]
You said that you could see[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]ripples[.]
of future disasters, is that it?[A]
And the greater the disaster, the[.]
more clearly you could read it?[.][A]
Does that mean you saw something?[.]
Some tremendous disaster to come?[.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]And in knowing about the disaster,
Lyon thought he could prevent it.[.][A]
Could he have[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
Was he studying the Sacred Stone to[.]
find a way to prevent this disaster?[A][OpenMidRight]And what will you do, now[.]
that you know this, too?[A]
Haven't you called such[.]
knowledge blasphemous?[A][OpenMidLeft]I[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]don't know what to do.[A]
If my mentor were here, I think[.]
he might be able to guide me.[.][A]
But I'm still so inexperienced.[.]
I feel lost in this dilemma.[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]But how can I not act on this?[A]
If I do nothing, knowing that[.]
something terrible will happen[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
If I could have helped[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
I[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove] I don't know what to do.[.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]Within five years, half of
Grado will be destroyed.[A][OpenMidLeft]Destroyed?[A][OpenMidRight]In the southern half of the continent,
there will be a terrible quake.[.][A]
The ground will shake violently.
The earth will crack open wide.[.][A]
Cities will fall. Fields will[.]
burn in the earth's hot blood.[A]
Few will survive.[.]
This is what we have foreseen.[A][OpenMidLeft]How-- How can this--[A][OpenMidRight]I advise you to leave Grado.[A]
You might be able to escape the disaster
if you head north to Renais or Frelia.[A][OpenMidLeft]No[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
I can't do that.[A]
When this disaster strikes, people
will need help and healing.[.][A]
If I could help them even a little
by staying behind[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]You would willingly risk certain
death to save a handful of people?[A][OpenMidLeft]If I died serving Grado, I would
have no regrets, Master Knoll.[A]
Thank you for sharing this. I will
make the most of this knowledge.[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][.....]
Spoken like a true cleric.[A]
You would drop everything without[.]
hesitation just to help others.[.][A]
This is the difference between mages
and priests. Knowledge versus sacrifice.[A]
[ToggleSmile]Perhaps you might allow me to join
you when the time comes[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Master Knoll?[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]If I am to honor Prince Lyon's
intentions, I cannot flee this.[.][A]
I am not sure how best I can help,
but I do not want anyone to die.[A]
Not if, by my action, I can save them.[A][OpenMidLeft]I understand how you feel,
Master Knoll[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
Let our strengths be united,
then, for the common good.[A]
[0CF2]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x111][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x113][OpenMidRight]Oh, great. Perfect timing.
You're a priestess, aren't you?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Y-yes. I am.
How may I--[.][A][OpenMidRight]Sorry, I'm in a bit of a hurry here. Uh,
could you heal this little guy for me?[A][OpenMidLeft]Heal[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]who?[.....]
Do you mean that kitten?[A][OpenMidRight]Yeah, what's the matter?
Can't you do kittens?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]No, that's not it. It's just,[.]
I was a little surprised to--[.][A][OpenMidRight]Whatever. Doesn't matter. If you
can heal him, hop to it![A][OpenMidLeft]Oh, yes[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove] Sorry.[.]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][.......][CloseSpeechSlow][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]There. He should be fine now.[.][A]
Aren't you a lucky little kitty?
This sweet man saved you![.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]Sweet man? Me? Heh.[.]
Lady, you don't know me.[A]
[ToggleSmile]But thanks for saving him.[A][ToggleSmile][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Not at all. I couldn't let
the little guy suffer.[A][OpenMidRight]The name's Cormag. I'm
glad I ran into you.[A][OpenMidLeft]I'm just glad I could help.[.]
My name is Natasha.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Well, I owe you one for[.]
saving the cat.[.][A]
If you need any help, just
call out, and I'll be here.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]I shall remember that, Cormag.[A]
[0CF3]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x111][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x113][OpenMidRight]Hey, it's Natasha, right?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Yes, that's right.
[ToggleSmile]How is the kitty doing?[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]I took him back to his mother.[A]
I figured he belonged back
with his mom.[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I agree.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]How about you? Where are
your parents in all this?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]I haven't seen them since I[.]
joined the clerical order.[A]
We would write, but it's been a[.]

I wonder how they are. I've[.]
been worried about them.[A][OpenMidRight]Are you from Grado, Natasha?[A][OpenMidLeft]Yes, I am.[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I thought so! You know what?
That's where I'm from, too![.][A]
[ToggleSmile]Where were you born? I'm
from the south myself.[A][OpenMidLeft]I was born in a village[.]
near the Renais border.[.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Ah, well, you've got nothing

fighting nothing but Grado soldiers.[A]
These are our countrymen.[.]
Our families[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]Every battle we win, I see only how[.]
many casualties we've caused.[.][A]
I'm a healer, but to win this, I
must turn my back on my countrymen.[.][A]
I have to let them suffer, when[.]
all I want to do is help them.[A]
But[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]But what?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Grado is responsible for all of[.]
this. Our homeland[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
Grado has caused so many deaths now.
We have no choice but to fight.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Ah. You see it now. That's the
sad irony of the battlefield.[.][A]
I ride a wyvern and use my spear to[.]
bring low men who should be my allies.[A]
We each joined this cause in hopes of[.]
bringing Grado to its senses.[.][A]
Our country has set the world on its
ear, and it's up to us to right things.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]I suppose[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][.....]
You know something, Natasha?[A]
You should never be ashamed of
the fact that you're from Grado.[A]
You have no debt to pay, no burden
of guilt to bear.[.][A]
Grado was once a magnificent country.[.]
Do what you can to restore that glory.[A]
It took only a handful of men to turn[.]
Grado down the wrong path,[A]
but perhaps a mere handful of soldiers
can set things right again.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]I understand, Cormag. I'll do what
I know to be right, no matter what.[.][A]
I feel like a heavy fog has been
lifted from my heart. Thank you.[A][OpenMidRight]Ah, I just wanted to see that lovely
smile on your face again.[.][A]
You and me, we've got lots to talk
about, I think. Let's do this again.[A][OpenMidLeft]I'd love to.[A]
[0CF5]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x12A][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x10F][OpenMidLeft]Hey, you're Prince Innes, aren't
you? I'm Joshua. Nice to meet you.[A][OpenMidRight]I'm sure.[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Well, now that we know each other[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
What say we play a quick game[.]
of chance, hm?[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]Hm? What are you planning[.]
on doing with that coin?[A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]We're gonna have a little[.]
wager. What else?[.][A]
If I'm going to fight alongside[.]
someone, I want to know him.[A]
And there's no better way to get to[.]
know someone than a friendly wager![.][A]
So[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove] What do you say to a[.]
starter bet of[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]1,000?[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]Betting? Here? You can't be serious.[A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Hey now. I always take gambling[.]
seriously. Always.[A]
Whether you live or die on the
field often comes down to luck.[.][A]
Every fight, you're putting your
life in someone else's hands.[.][A]
You should be glad to meet up[.]
with such a lucky guy.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]You may rely on luck, but[.]
I prefer raw skill.[.][A]
However, we might as well. Put
your money where your mouth is.[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Now you're talking![.][A]
Right, here we go![A]
[ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft][MoveMidLeft][OpenMidLeft][......][ToggleSmile]Heads or tails?[.]
What's your call?[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]Tails.[A][OpenMidLeft]Let's see what we've got[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[ToggleSmile]Oh, well. It's heads.[.][A]
Too bad, Your Highness. You lost.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]What? That's impossible.
I saw--[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]C'est la vie.[.][A]
Look closely. See? It's heads.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]That's strange[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
My eyes never fail me, but
I could have sworn--[A]
[ToggleSmile]Hm. There seems to be more to[.]
betting than meets the eye.[.][A][ToggleSmile][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Figure that out already?
You're a quick study.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Yeah.[.][A]
Let's try that again.[.]
I'll get it this time[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[0CF6]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x12A][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x10F][OpenMidRight]Tails.[A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]Heads again.[A]
That's ten losses in a row.[.][A][OpenMidRight]I don't care. Next bet.[.]
Double or nothing. Tails.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Shouldn't you stop soon?[A]
Maybe you've got the cash back
home, but you're on the road.[.][A]
And I'm willing to bet you're[.]
not carrying that much on you.[A][OpenMidRight]No, keep going.[.][A]
I don't feel like quitting
on a bad streak.[A][OpenMidLeft]Fine, fine[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
But then can we call
it quits?[.][A]
You've let me win enough, and[.]
I don't want to bleed you dry.[A][OpenMidRight]No. I won't let you leave, not
while you're still ahead.[.][A]
Hurry up. We don't have the[.]
luxury of time here.[A][OpenMidLeft]What's that saying? The cooler
the head, the hotter he bets?[.][A]
Something like that. And you seem[.]
pretty cool most of the time.[.][A]
[ToggleSmile]I guess the old saying is true.[.][A][ToggleSmile]
[0CF7]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x12A][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x10F][OpenMidRight]Thanks for waiting.[.]
Let's get started.[A][OpenMidLeft]You can't be serious.[.]
You want to keep going?[.][A][OpenMidRight]Just flip the coin.[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]Oh, brother.[A]
[ToggleSmile]Your Highness, I have a little
admission to make here.[.][A]
You have no chance of winning.
The whole thing is rigged.[A][OpenMidRight]Rigged[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]Yeah. You flip the coin[.]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]like this.[A]
Then catch it in the hand.[A]
I'm the one holding the coin.[.][A]
I can turn it over any way I choose[.]
just by moving my palm a bit.[.][A]
[OpenMidLeft][MoveMidLeft][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Like this.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]Hmm[.][ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]That's how you did it[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
I knew you were up to something.[A]
It was straining my disbelief that
you could keep winning like that.[.][A]
Strange that I couldn't catch[.]
on to your little trick, though.[A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]That's nice of you to say, but
I'm sure you must have suspected.[.][A]
There's a guy who hangs out near
a pub in Jehanna. He's real smooth.[.][A]
His secret is to mix in just enough[.]
losses to make it look plausible.[.][A]
If you ever go there, you'll know[.]
the guy I'm talking about right away.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]Interesting. I've never had any[.]
experience with this sort of thing.[.][A]
One only has so much time when he's[.]
groomed to become the king, you know.[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I can imagine.[A]
But a king must have a wide range[.]
of knowledge, don't you think?[A]
When I was a journeyman, I lost[.]
a lot of money to scams like this.[A]
I started learning these tricks so
they couldn't be used on me anymore![A]
It's all rubbish, innit? But it's not[.]
a bad thing to add to your experience.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]I must hand it to you, you
have a point.[.][A]
Some things, you can only[.]
learn firsthand, on the field.[A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Well, I've given away enough
of my secrets for one day.[A]
I'll give you back all the money
I took you for, so go easy on me[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]Wait.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Hm?[.][A][OpenMidRight]There's no need to give it back.[A]
That I failed to see your trick[.]
was my own failing.[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]You serious?[A]
All right. Good deal.[.]
You're a good man.[A]
Let's just call this
your tuition fee, eh?[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]Wait.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Now what? What is it this time?[.][A][OpenMidRight]We're still in the middle of the bet.[.][A]
We'll pick up where we left off.[A][OpenMidLeft]Are you saying[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
you want to keep going?[.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Naturally.[A]
You've revealed your secrets to[.]
me. My luck is bound to change.[.][A]
I feel a winning streak coming on.[A][ToggleSmile][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]Oh, brother.[A]
Well, you're persistent,
I'll give you that much.[A]
Call it in the air.[.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]Tails.[A]
[0CF8]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x12A][OpenMidLeft]So, is today my lucky day? Or[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidLeft][MoveMidLeft][OpenMidLeft][......][Clear]Tails, hm?[.....][A]
[ToggleSmile]Oh, well. Luck's just not on
my side today, I guess.[.][A][ToggleSmile][......][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x122][OpenMidRight]Oh, may I ask what you are doing?[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Hm? Oh, I was just checking my luck.[A]
Looks like today is not set to be[.]
one of my better ones.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]That's not good![A]
Perhaps if you gave up that coin
for some good, honest prayer[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
I have no need of luck, you see,
for I benefit from divine grace![A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]That sounds nice. I'd love to[.]
have a bit of that myself.[A]
All right, let's have a quick[.]
bet to see which is better.[.][A]
We'll test your divine grace
against my good old luck.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]Oh, I could never give in to such[.]
a vile sin.[.][A]
Gambling is a pox, a boil upon
the fair skin of mankind.[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]That's going a bit far,[.]
don't you think?[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]Gambling corrupts the masses,[.]
and I'll have none of it.[.][A]
Which is the more noble: to earn
your keep or to swindle it?[.][A]
And besides, this is a battlefield,[.]
not a gambling hall.[A]
No, I simply will not indulge in
such spiritual pollution here.[A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Oh, you're really making too
much of a big deal out of it.[.][A]
This is just a coin toss. You can[.]
flip a coin just about anywhere.[A]
[ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft][MoveMidLeft][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Let's see[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][Clear]
Well, heads or tails?[.]
What is it?[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]Since you refuse to resist
the evils of temptation[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
I shall have to teach you a[.]
lesson you won't soon forget.[.][A]
Heads![A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I knew you'd come around![.]
Right, so let's see here[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[ToggleSmile]Hey! It's heads!
You really are lucky![.][A][OpenMidRight]Huh? I won?[.][A]
[ToggleSmile]Well, of course I won! I shouldn't
be so surprised. It was fate.[.][A]
One as blessed as I could never lose
at something so base as gambling.[.][A][ToggleSmile][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Great, so let's keep going.[.][A]
How about putting some money
down this time? 100 gold coins?[.][A][OpenMidRight]That's fine.[A]
Anything I win will, of course,[.]
fund only noble causes.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]That's my girl[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
Are you ready? Heads or[.]
tails, what's your call?[A][OpenMidRight]Heads. What else?[.][A]
[0CF9]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x12A][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x122][OpenMidLeft]Hi, there.[A][OpenMidRight]Hello, Joshua.[A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Do you have a few minutes to spare?[.]
I wanted to win back my money.[A]
You were doing pretty well the
other day. I was overconfident.[.][A]
But today, I'm feeling lucky.[.][A][ToggleSmile][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]I accept your proposal.[.][A]
But remember, I think that gambling[.]
is an immoral, inexcusable pastime.[.][A]
You can tell it is wicked, because
of how good you feel when you win.[A][OpenMidLeft]Can't disagree with you there.[A]
Last time, I went easy on you[.]
because you were an amateur.[A]
Don't think I'm gonna throw[.]
away my money like that today.[A][OpenMidRight]I would never ask you to go easy
on me, Joshua.[A]
After all, I have righteousness at
my side, and I need no favors.[A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Righteousness? Is that
what you've got?[A]
[ToggleSmile]And to think, you were the one
telling me gambling was wrong![A][OpenMidRight]Oh, but it is wrong. I meant to teach you[.]
a lesson, and your lesson continues.[A]
When done for a just cause, surely
gambling could not possibly be wrong.[.][A]
Now, let's see the color of[.]
your money![.][A]
[0CFA]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x12A][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x122][OpenMidRight]Look, Joshua![.]
I won again![A][OpenMidLeft]Arrrgh![.][A][OpenMidRight][MoveMidRight][OpenMidRight]What do you mean, making such[.]
rude noises in front of a lady!?[A]
You're slowing down the game![.][A][OpenMidLeft]Hold on, give me a break![.][A]
You got me. I lost.[.]
I've had enough.[A]
It's just like you said.
I shouldn't gamble anymore.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Are you quitting on me?[.]
Where's your spirit?[A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]Man. I just don't get it.[.]
Not at all.[.][A]
You must really have some sort of[.]
divine powers on your side.[.][A]
I mean, I've been fixing every
single game, and I still can't wi--[.][A][OpenMidRight]Fixing? What do you mean? The[.]
game's not broken. I'm doing fine![A][OpenMidLeft]Uh[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]No, I-- [ToggleSmile]Nothing.[A]
[ToggleSmile]Anyway, I'm all done. I don't[.]
want to play with you anymore.[A]
Go take someone else for a ride.[A][OpenMidRight]A ride? Like on a horse? What[.]
are you talking about?[A][OpenMidLeft]Look, what I'm trying to say is[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
You don't know anything, and you
STILL managed to beat me![.][A][OpenMidRight][MoveMidRight][OpenMidRight]What do you mean, I don't know
anything? Oh! Such disrespect![A]
What do you know, other than
gambling? Tell me that![.][A][OpenMidLeft]Hm? Let's see[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[ToggleSmile]I know how to survive in
a desert, for one thing.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]I think we're all quite familiar
with the hardships of travel by now![A]
If that's all you've got, don't go
around telling me I'M the ignorant one![.][A][OpenMidLeft]Aaaah! Enough already! Fine! Fine!
I was wrong!!![A]
Anyway, the point is that I'm not[.]
gambling with you ANYMORE![A][OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][......][OpenMidRight]Oh! He ran away!
[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]Why do they always run away?[A]
Who will I play with now?[.][A][Clear]
[ToggleSmile]Oh, I have an idea![.][A]
We can build a gambling hall
in Rausten! Yes, I'm brilliant![.][A]
I simply must bring this up with
Uncle next time I see him![A][ToggleSmile]
[0CFB]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x11E][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x12A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Hey, I hear you're good[.]
with a sword[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Who are you?[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I'm Joshua.[.]
And you?[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Marisa.[.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]It's a pleasure. By the[.]
way, you ever hear this?[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Hear what?[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Well, I guess it was popular for
a while, way back when.[.][A]
But when two swordsmen met on the[.]
battlefield--even allied swordsmen--[A]
they would duel it out to test one
another's worth with the blade.[.][A]
So what do you say? Don't you think[.]
it's time to revive this tradition?[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][.....]
You want me to kill you?[A][OpenMidRight]No, no, no. I'm not saying we have
to fight to the death![A]
[ToggleSmile]It's just a simple test of skill.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]Fine. As long as I get a chance[.]
to whet my blade's appetite.[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Er[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove] Great! Now, what say we
make this more interesting?[.][A]
If I win, you owe me, and[.]
if you win, then I owe you.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Owe me what?[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]I'm not quite sure yet.[.][A]
How about[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove] Ah, yes.[.]
How about you owe me a favor.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]I'm not following you.[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]No?[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]But it doesn't matter. I'm
not going to lose to you.[.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Now you're talking.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Then let's get started.[.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Whoa! Hold your horses! Where's the[.]
hurry? Let's do this another day.[.][A]
After all, I like to savor the
anticipation a little bit.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]I don't get it,[.]
but fine.[.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Great! We're all set then.[A]
Next time we meet, we[.]
cross swords. Deal?[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
There's nothing to anticipate.
You're simply going to lose.[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Well, I don't know about that.[A]
See you later. I'm looking
forward to it.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Same here.[A]
[0CFC]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x12A][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x11E][OpenMidRight][MoveLeft][OpenMidLeft][MoveFarLeft][OpenFarLeft]Oh[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]Tsk![A][CloseSpeechSlow][OpenFarLeft][MoveMidLeft][OpenLeft][MoveRight][OpenRight][ToggleMouthMove]...![ToggleMouthMove][A][CloseSpeechSlow][OpenRight][MoveFarRight][OpenFarRight][MoveFarRight][OpenFarRight][MoveLeft][OpenMidLeft][MoveFarLeft][OpenFarLeft]Dang[ToggleMouthMove]...![ToggleMouthMove]
There!![.][A][CloseSpeechSlow][OpenFarLeft][MoveMidLeft][OpenLeft][MoveRight][OpenRight]Ha![.]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenRight][ClearFace][.......][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x12A][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x11E][OpenMidLeft]Whew[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove] After a match like that,[.]
[ToggleSmile]I can be happy with a tie![A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]You're better than I thought.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]You're not too bad yourself.[A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Heh[.][ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]Thanks.[.][A]
But remember, I was at a slight[.]
disadvantage, so[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]I must admit, I did hold you at[.]
a slight disadvantage.[A]
However, we are closely matched,
despite our incompatible styles.[A]
I simply couldn't land a decisive[.]
blow. But it was all worthwhile.[A]
After all, I've learned, and that[.]
is worth far more than any wager.[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I see.
[ToggleSmile]You're a quick one, aren't you?[.][A]
How did you get that good?[A][OpenMidRight]Fighting is all I have.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]You live for the sword, eh?[.][A]
[ToggleSmile]I prefer rolling the dice to
swinging the sword, you know?[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]Why is that?[A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Whew[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][.....][A]
I thought you'd never ask.[A]
[ToggleSmile]You're asking how I got hooked
on gambling, right?[.][A]
Let me see[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove] There's not
much to tell.[.][A]
I guess by the time I realized it,
[ToggleSmile]it was already too late.[A]
I'd grown bored of everything[.]
before I discovered gambling.[.][A]
But then I saw it--gambling was[.]
like life, in short little bursts.[A]
Life itself is just one big gamble![.]
[ToggleSmile]That's how I see things.[A][OpenMidRight]I see.
[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
I don't know anything about[.]
gambling, but it was a good duel.[.][A]
We must try this again soon.[A][OpenMidLeft]What, with no wager? That[.]
doesn't sound very fun.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Suit yourself.[A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]You mean that? Then we'll[.]
have another bet.[.][A]
I'll win next time.[.]
See you later.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]See you.[A]
[0CFD]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x12A][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x11E][OpenMidRight][MoveFarRight][OpenMidLeft][MoveRight][OpenRight]There![A][SendToBack][OpenFarRight]Ho![.][A][CloseSpeechSlow][OpenFarRight][MoveFarFarRight][OpenRight][MoveLeft][OpenLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][.....]
How's this?[.][A][FastPrint2][OpenFarFarRight][MoveFarRight][OpenFarRight]Oof[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenLeft][ClearFace][OpenFarRight][ClearFace][.......][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x12A][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x11E][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Whew[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
Looks like I won this time.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][.....]
I made a mistake.[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]No, you're just having a bad day.[.][A]
And it's not like I had a[.]
decisive victory this time.[.][A]
I'd say we're still just
about even.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]All that matters is that
I didn't win.[.][A]
You won the bet. What[.]
do you want me to do?[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Oh, you remembered our last bet!
That makes me happy.[A]
All right, here goes[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]I want you to be my partner[.]
for a while[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[ToggleSmile]How's that sound?[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]What?[.][....]
Your partner?[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Don't get the wrong idea. I just meant
for training. And gambling.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]So, nothing would change[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Well, I suppose, but there's still
a point to it all.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]What's that?[A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]If I train with you, I'm going
to become a better swordsman.[.][A]
And if we train together, maybe[.]
we'll each learn something.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]I could ask nothing better.[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]And there's something that I want to
do soon when the war is over.[.][A]
It's something that can't be done[.]
in a single day or overnight.[.][A]
You could probably call this the
biggest gamble of my entire life.[.][A]
I'm going to have to hone my skills,
and I'll need someone to help me.[.][A]
[ToggleSmile]What do you say, Marisa?
Won't you lend me a hand?[.][A][OpenMidRight]I'm good for fighting, and
not much else.[A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]You think? I doubt that's true.[.][A]
Well, think about it.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]I'll do it.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]I know this is a gamble, but[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
[ToggleSmile]gambling is my hobby.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]I see that.[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Well, don't let me down.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]I won't. But try to keep it[.]
interesting, all right?[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Heh. Then I'll do my best to
keep you entertained.[.][A]
And remember what I said[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
Life is a gamble.[.][A]
You never know what'll happen.[A]
But don't worry. I'm sure you[.]
won't be bored.[.][A]
Besides, how often do you meet
someone you can spar with?[A]
[ToggleSmile]Not to mention someone who
can actually beat you![A][OpenMidRight]I'll win next time, though.[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]That's the spirit, Marisa.[A][ToggleSmile]

a title. Use it.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]Oh[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove] My mistake. Pardon me.[.]
I'm Joshua.[.][A]
I heard you once commanded a band[.]
of over a hundred mercenaries.[A]
I've been wanting to talk to you.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Huh. So that's what you've heard, is
it? You look a bit on the rough side.[.][A]
Yeah, I can see it in your eyes. You're[.]
no ordinary swordsman, are you?[.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]It's just like they said.[.][A]
You're a natural leader. Commanding and[.]
observant--it's a rare combination.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Ah, thanks. So what brings you
over here, anyway?[A]
Didn't just come here to say
hello, did you?[.][A][OpenMidRight]You ARE a sharp one.[A][OpenMidLeft]Not half as sharp as your sword,
from what I've seen out there.[A][OpenMidRight]Actually, I'm here with an offer,[.]
but I didn't want to rush into it.[A]
I'd hate to mess this one up.[.][A]
I can't go into the details just
now, but it's a big job.[A]
I'm guessing it'll pay pretty[.]
well, too.[A][OpenMidLeft]I see.[A]
Well, you have me curious. I'm looking
forward to hearing your offer.[A][OpenMidRight]You should be.[A]
[0CFF]
[ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x12A][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x11B][OpenMidLeft]Hey, Gerik.[.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Is that you, Joshua?
[ToggleSmile]So, I hear you like to gamble.[A][OpenMidLeft]You hear right. Care to[.]
try your luck?[A][OpenMidRight]Ha ha ha. I'll pass.[A]
But tell me, why do you[.]
like gambling so much?[A][OpenMidLeft]I've got my reasons. Mostly, I just[.]
like to believe in my own luck.[.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Luck?[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Oh, yeah[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
See, you can have all the skill in
the world and still have a bad day.[.][A]
It doesn't take much for the most[.]
fortunate man around to have a fall.[A]
A royal family at the height of their[.]
power gets betrayed, and that's the end.[A]
It's life really, innit?[A][OpenMidRight]Hmm[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
You've got a point there.[.][A]
[ToggleSmile]But you know, Joshua, you don't[.]
want to use luck as an excuse.[A]
Don't blame luck if you lose a
fight. Blame yourself, but not luck.[A]
Renais didn't fall because of bad[.]
fortune. It was malice that did it.[.][A]
You're right--there's good luck and[.]
bad, but it's no excuse for failure.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Well, that's a good point[.]
you've got there.[.][A]
[ToggleSmile]But I think I'll just keep
believing in my luck for now.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Whatever works for you.[.][A]
If you're an even match against[.]
someone, sure, luck is a factor.[A]
But you're not counting on luck[.]
alone, are you?[.][A]
You're a fine swordsman, and that[.]
isn't all luck's doing there.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]You are far too observant.
We're lucky you're on our side.[.][A][OpenMidRight]That's the best compliment
a mercenary can get.[A][OpenMidLeft]Call it a hunch, but I think this is
the start of a long friendship.[.][A][OpenMidRight]You think so, huh?[A]
I wonder if that's just[.]
a lucky guess.[A][OpenMidLeft]Well, I'm a lucky guy.[A]
[0D00]
[ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x12A][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x11B][OpenMidRight]Hey, Joshua, I don't mind a little
friendly gambling with my men,[A]
but would you mind not fleecing[.]
them too much? It's demoralizing.[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Hm?[.][.....]
[ToggleSmile]Oh, you're talking about those guys?[A]
Man! They wore me out! They just kept[.]
losing and losing and losing,[.][A]
and they still wouldn't give up![A]
If they'll risk so much on a bet, they
might risk too much in a battle.[A]
You're their commander. You should
have a word with them.[A][OpenMidRight]Ha ha ha[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]Good point. I'll talk to
the boys. But, Joshua[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[ToggleSmile]I'm going to have to win back the[.]
money that you took from my men.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]It's about time! I've been waiting
for you to put the challenge to me.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Oh, I'll do more than[.]
just challenge you.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]So if you win, I'll cough up
your men's money.[.][A]
And if I win[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]What's it going to be?
Come on, out with it.[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I want you to join me when
this war is over.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]That's all you want?[A]
Well, it doesn't sound like your
standard mercenary assignment,[A]
but you've piqued my interest.
This sounds like a big bet.[.][A]
I'm not sure I get what you're
after in all this, but[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[ToggleSmile]Fine. You've got a bet.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Great, then let's go[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
How 'bout we flip a coin?[.][A][OpenMidRight]That's it? I'm wagering my
life on a coin toss?[A]
Eh, why not? Flip it.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Heads or tails?[.]
What's your call?[.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]Heads.[A][OpenMidLeft]Which leaves me with tails.[.]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]Here it goes[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[ToggleSmile]Hup![A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft][MoveMidLeft][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]Ready to see what it is?[A]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
[ToggleSmile]Look! It's tails![.][A][ToggleSmile][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]I won. Now, let me have[.]
the men's money back.[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]Wait, you called heads[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]I sure did. But you cheated.
Open your left hand.[A]
There--you palmed the coin
and swapped in a fake one.[A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][Clear]
You ARE observant. Not a lot of people can
see through that. You're right. You win.[A]
Here, I'll give you back the money.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]Ha ha ha. Thanks, Joshua. I'll
get this back to the men.[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Mind if I ask how you[.]
found me out?[.][A]
I like to think I've gotten[.]
pretty good at that trick.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]Before I became a mercenary, gambling[.]
was my one true love in life.[.][A]
I've had to learn how to see through
a LOT of tricks in my day.[A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]So, wait[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove] You just pretended[.]
not to be interested in gambling?[.][A]
[ToggleSmile]You're really something. You pulled[.]
a fast one on me. Today's not my--[A][OpenMidRight]Not your lucky day? Don't say that, Joshua.[.]
You were just out of your league is all.[A][OpenMidLeft]I'm starting to think maybe I was.
But then again, maybe not[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
Maybe today was just YOUR lucky day.[A][OpenMidRight]Ha ha ha[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
I like your enthusiasm.[.][A]
And I'm glad you appreciate[.]
my gambling prowess.[A][OpenMidLeft]I haven't given up on you yet.[A]
When this war is over, let's
have us a quick duel.[.][A]
If I win, you come work for me.[.][A][OpenMidRight]You're on. Just make sure[.]
you stay alive until then.[A][OpenMidLeft]Don't worry. I'm feeling lucky.[.][A]
[0D01]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x116][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x118][OpenMidRight]Hello, Forde.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Hmm?[.....]
[ToggleSmile]Oh, Kyle! How have you been?[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]What are you doing out here?
Are you--[.][......] Are you painting?[A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]No! I-- Well, yes. Actually, I'm
not so much painting as sketching.[A]
I use this piece of charcoal to[.]
draw and shade, like this.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]You know we're in the middle
of a battle, don't you?[.][A]
What if someone attacks while[.]
you're distracted?[A][OpenMidLeft]Calm down, calm down.[.][A]
I just like to keep a record of[.]
our battles with these pictures.[A][OpenMidRight]You're just rationalizing![A]
You're a cavalier--it's time
to start acting like one.[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Fine, fine. I'll stop.[A]
As you command, Sir Kyle, commander[.]
of the Knights of Renais.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]Oh, brother. Do you have to[.]
make everything so difficult?[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]If you don't want the hassle,[.]
stop telling me what to do![.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]Then stop fooling around on the[.]
battlefield.[A]
Seriously, wasting my time on an
idiot like you is just stupid.[A][OpenMidLeft]Huh?[.....]
Did you say something?[A][OpenMidRight]Nothing![A]
If you have so much time to waste[.]
drawing, let's have a quick spar.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]What! You want to spar? Now?[A][OpenMidRight]Yeah, that's right. I don't waste time.[.][A]
I take care of my weapons, my horse,
and myself.[.][A]
And not just that--I also make sure our[.]
morale is good and our men are safe.[A][OpenMidLeft]You're thorough, aren't you?[A][OpenMidRight]I'm a knight. It's my duty.[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]You really need to take[.]
yourself less seriously.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]And you need to take your[.]
duty MORE seriously.[A]
[0D02]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x116][OpenMidRight][HalfCloseEyes][OpenMidRight]Yaaaaaaawn[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[ToggleSmile]Oh, why am I so sleepy?[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x118][OpenMidLeft]Forde! Are you falling asleep[.]
on the battlefield!?[A]
What is wrong with you, man!?[.][A][OpenMidRight][OpenEyes][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]What are you so fired up about?[.]
You're really ruining my nap.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]You have no sense of self-preservation,[.]
do you? What is wrong with you?[.][A]
You lack even the common sense of[.]
an infant, you know that?[.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Oh, you're one to talk.[.][A]
When you were a baby, you were planning[.]
out strategies to take over the nursery.[A]
You were stuck up then, and you're stuck
up now. And STILL the ladies liked you![.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]You leave them out of this![.]
Women have nothing to do with it.[.][A][OpenMidRight]They don't? Oh, come on![A]
Isn't it important to have an heir to[.]
carry your standard when you're gone?[.][A]
Take your sister, Mia--she married
into a nice Frelian family, didn't she?[.][A]
I'm just curious who would ever settle
for such an uptight knight as you.[A]
You ever think about that? You think
you might meet her in this war?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]That's not what I'm here for![.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Ha ha ha ha. Of course not. But I[.]
bet you're still a ladies' man, huh?[A]
I know you--you're a perfect gentlemen,[.]
always nice to the ladies.[A]
I remember when you were little, you
were always the first to help when[A]
you saw a little girl crying. You[.]
would go running up to lend a hand.[.][A]
I still remember how impressed I was
that you would do that. It was cool.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]I just could never turn my back[.]
on someone in need.[.][A]
It is what's expected of a knight.[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yeah, but you weren't a knight yet![.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Well, it's[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]expected of someone[.]
who aspires to be a knight, too![A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]You've got an answer for everything![A]
But, I have to admit, you've also[.]
got my respect. You're a good guy.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Wow! Now you're embarrassed.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Forde![A]
[0D03]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x116][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x118][OpenMidRight]Whew[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]What's wrong, Kyle? You're the
one who looks tired this time.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]Oh, Forde. It's you. I was just[.]
lost in thought for a moment.[.][A]
I figured that I could use a
little breathing room.[A]
I guess that's why you paint
your landscapes, isn't it?[A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]That's right. You see it now?[.][A]
Everyone needs a little space to
think, even on the battlefield.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]Well, I wouldn't go so far as to
approve of painting during a battle.[A]
What if the younger soldiers started
to copy your example?[.][A]
However, I see your point. Everyone[.]
needs a way to clear one's head.[A]
So[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove] How long have you been[.]
doing those drawings, anyway?[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]What's the matter? Forgotten
when you started?[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
I started drawing and painting
when my mother died.[A][OpenMidRight]Really?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]When I was young, I won a tournament
for training swordsmen[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]I remember that.
I took second place.[A][OpenMidLeft]She seemed far more pleased at a picture
I'd drawn of her than at my victory.[A]
She kept that picture near her always,
and she looked at it often.[.][A]
She rejoiced more in my skill with the
brush than in my skill with the sword.[A]
I never understood why[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove] Not until
recently, at any rate.[A][OpenMidRight]Your mother was very kind.
I remember that about her.[A]
I'm sorry that she fell ill[.]
while you were so young.[A][OpenMidLeft]I feel lucky--I have my memories
of her, after all.[A]
Franz, though[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove] He was too little
to talk or even walk.[.][A]
That's why I kept that picture of[.]
her hanging in our home.[A][OpenMidRight]So that's the story behind that[.]
picture in your house[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
I didn't realize you drew it.[.][A]
I remember watching you practice
swordplay when we were little.[A]
I wanted to be like you, and I was
irritated that I didn't practice more.[A]
I got so upset with myself when I lost
the tournament to you.[A]
That's why I work so hard to keep[.]
practicing and improving my skills.[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]I didn't know[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Oh, man. It's not like me to get
this introspective.[.][A]
What is it about you that makes me
talk so much?[.][A]
Come on, let's go.[A][ToggleSmile][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]Heh. All right.[.][A]
Oh, and, Forde[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]What?[.][A][OpenMidRight]When this whole war is over,
teach me how to paint.[A][OpenMidLeft]Yeah, all right. Fine. But we both
have to get out of here alive first.[A][OpenMidRight]It's a deal.[A]
[0D04]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x12B][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x118][OpenMidRight]You're Selena, aren't you? Commander
of Frelia's pegasus knights?[A][OpenMidLeft]I am.[.][A]
And I know who you are. You are[.]
Sir Kyle, cavalier of Renais.[.][A][OpenMidRight]I'm honored that you know my name.
I don't believe we've met, have we?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]We met once, about ten years ago
or so. You may have forgotten.[A][OpenMidRight]Ten years ago[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][.....] Wait,
you're[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]THAT Syrene!?[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]So, you've finally remembered me?[.][A][ToggleSmile][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]Do I ever! I didn't think[.]
I'd ever see you again.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Well, Sir Kyle, you certainly[.]
have turned out well.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Oh, please. Let's do away with
the honorifics, shall we?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Of course, Kyle. Ah, you haven't
changed at all. It takes me back.[.][A][OpenMidRight]I barely recognized you, Syrene.
You look completely changed.[A]
I had no idea you'd become a
knight--a pegasus knight, no less![A][OpenMidLeft]That's nice of you to say.
So I've grown, have I?[A][OpenMidRight]You've grown a lot. It's a shame we[.]
have to be reunited on a battlefield.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]You're right about that. We ought[.]
to sit down and talk soon.[A][OpenMidRight]I'd like that, too, Syrene. But let's[.]
finish off this lot first, shall we?[A][OpenMidLeft]All right, but don't try to be a
hero like last time, all right?[.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]A hero? What did I do?[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Well, that's your homework.[.]
See if you can't remember.[A]
[0D05]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x118][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x12B][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]How are you holding up, Kyle?[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]The war is tough, but my sword
arm is strong, and I am well.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Mmm. That's an awfully stuffy response.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Stuffy? It's accurate.
Isn't that enough?[A]
But that's beside the point. I still can't
figure out what you were talking about.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Oh, your homework? You've been thinking[.]
about it all this time? You're so serious![A]
[ToggleSmile]I was right. You haven't changed in the[.]
slightest. You've always been this way.[.][A]
Remember when I tried to show you around
Frelia's castle town?[.][A]
You said, [OpenQuote]I'm here to do my duty. Not to[.]
sightsee,[CloseQuote] and you went back inside.[A]
You went home without even trying[.]
Frelia's fabulous seafood![A]
King Hayden thought I'd been remiss[.]
in showing you our fair city.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]I'm sorry about that, Syrene.[.]
I had no idea[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
I was on a special mission to[.]
deliver a letter to King Hayden.[A]
I didn't have any time for
sightseeing, like I'd said.[.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Are you seriously apologizing[.]
for that? It was so long ago![.][A][ToggleSmile][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Ha ha ha[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove] You're right,
you're right.[.][A]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]I know I was only there for three[.]
days, but that was a memorable trip.[A]
I grew up in landlocked Renais. I'd[.]
never seen the ocean.[.][A]
Not before you showed it to me.[.][A][OpenMidRight]You didn't show any interest at[.]
all in local culture or cuisine.[A]
But when I asked if you'd like to[.]
go to the sea, you got so excited![A][OpenMidLeft]It was intense. I felt so small,
standing there, staring at the sea.[.][A]
Looking over the waves, I hoped that I
could be that strong, that persistent.[A][OpenMidRight]I think that's the only time
I've ever seen the real you.[A]
I know we only spent a half day[.]
together, but it was such fun.[A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Really?[.]
[ToggleSmile]I'm glad to hear that.[A][OpenMidRight]Maybe sometime, we can
do that again.[A][OpenMidLeft]I'd like that. Let's use that[.]
hope to drive us on.[A]
When we've restored peace, we'll
go see the Frelian coast again.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Yes, definitely.[A]
[0D06]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x12B][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x118][OpenMidRight]What's wrong, Syrene?[.]
Are you hurt?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]No, I'm fine, but I'm worried[.]
about my pegasus[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]Here, let me take a look.[.][A]
Hm. Looks like he's got a wound here
that hasn't properly healed.[A]
[ToggleSmile]I can fix this up for you.[A]
It's nothing serious, but you might want
to get him some proper care later.[A][ToggleSmile][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Thanks, Kyle. You're a lifesaver.[.][A]
[ToggleSmile]It was careless of me not to
have noticed the injury.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]Your pegasus is smart. He may have hidden[.]
it from you so as not to worry you.[.][A]
It's not your fault, Syrene. You
shouldn't worry about it.[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]No, I'm just not fit to be a pegasus
knight. I'm so pitiful.[.][A]
If you hadn't seen that injury, I could[.]
have put us both in danger.[.][A]
I could have cost us both our lives.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]You're being too hard on yourself.[A]
If you were in danger, I would have[.]
been at your side in an instant.[A]
I'm sure you would do the same,[.]
wouldn't you?[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]Yes, gladly.[A][OpenMidRight]We just have to help one another
out if something happens.[.][A]
You and I have been friends for[.]
over ten years, after all.[A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]For over ten years?[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]That's right, Syrene. You did[.]
the same for me back then.[A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]Back then?[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]It was on the day I left Frelia.[A]
Near the border, I came upon some[.]
bandits harassing a poor merchant.[A]
I tried to help him, but I was
outnumbered. Badly.[.][A]
When they saw I was a knight, they
wasted no time surrounding me.[A]
I thought that was it for me, but[.]
then, out of nowhere, you show up.[A]
You and I drove off those bandits,
and you saved my life that day.[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I see you've finished your homework.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]Oh, so that's what you wanted me to[.]
remember! [OpenQuote]Don't be a hero[CloseQuote] indeed![.][A][OpenMidLeft]You'd left Frelia before I could give[.]
you a going-away present.[.][A]
I went out, hoping to catch up to you,
when I saw you surrounded by bandits.[.][A]
You were fighting all those bandits[.]
on your own to save that merchant[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
I'd never seen a knight so dedicated
to the protection of the innocent.[A][OpenMidRight]Going-away present[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove] You're[.]
talking about this, aren't you?[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]The wooden pegasus I carved for you!
[ToggleSmile][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]You still have it?[A][OpenMidRight]Of course I do! After we dealt with[.]
those bandits, you said to me,[A]
[OpenQuote]Keep this, and remember Frelia.[CloseQuote][.][A]
How could I possibly misplace it?[.]
I carry it with me as a reminder.[.][A]
As long as I have this, I feel like I'll
always have someone watching over me.[.][A]
Actually, I started collecting wooden[.]
figurines since you gave me this.[.][A]
But I always carry this one on me.[A][OpenMidLeft]I'm glad to hear it's[.]
meant so much to you.[.][A][OpenMidRight]I'll treasure it always.[A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][.....]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]Kyle[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
When we're all at peace again,
won't you visit Frelia once more?[.][A][OpenMidRight]You know[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][.....]
I was thinking about that, too.[.][A]
I think I really missed out by
not having Frelian seafood.[.][A]
This time around, I won't miss it.
And I should see some sights, too.[A]
Will you show me around, Syrene?[A][OpenMidLeft]Yes, I'd love to. I've been told
I can fry up a mean fish, too![A]
[0D07]
[ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x12C][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x12B][OpenMidLeft][MoveMidLeft][OpenMidLeft]Syrene![.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Princess Tana! You've put the[.]
whole court in an uproar, you know?[.][A]
Running off to fight with this
troop without a word to your father?[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]I'm sorry for all the trouble[.]
I've caused, but I'm fine.[A][OpenMidRight]I was ordered to watch over you[.]
and ensure your safe return.[A]
I intend to stay by your side and[.]
serve as your bodyguard, Princess.[A][OpenMidLeft]I'm happy to have you at my[.]
side, Syrene.[.][A]
Honestly, I was starting to[.]
get a little fed up.[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Why is that, Princess?[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I saw that letter my father had[.]
sent. [OpenQuote]Defend Tana to the death[CloseQuote]!?[A]
Is he serious? The soldiers think[.]
so--they won't leave me alone![A]
I appreciate the concern, but[.]
I'd like a LITTLE privacy![A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]Ha ha ha[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][.....]
That does sound like King Hayden.[.][A]
He looked so sad when you left.[.]
It was more than I could bear.[A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]I know. I feel bad[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
[ToggleSmile]Hey, Syrene.[A]
Doesn't this remind you of when[.]
we were children?[.][A]
When we were together, it was like
I finally had an older sister.[A][OpenMidRight]That was my first assignment after
graduating from the academy.[A]
I'd been asked to watch over you.[.]
It was a huge job for a young knight.[.][A]
But I enjoyed my work. You were[.]
always so kind. I miss those days.[A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I was so lonely when you got
promoted to the pegasus knights.[A]
[ToggleSmile]But now, I'm glad to see you've[.]
risen so high.[A]
It means that, even out here in the[.]
battlefield, we can spend time together.[A]
I want to talk about the old days,
about Frelia and my father.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Yes, let's.[.][A]
Shall we go now?[A][OpenMidLeft]All right, but don't
forget about tonight![.][A]
[0D08]
[ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x12C][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x12B][OpenMidLeft]Hello, Syrene![A]
I'm so glad we talked the other[.]
night. I had so much fun.[.][A][OpenMidRight]I did, too, my lady. I was
quite surprised, in fact.[.][A]
The young Princess Tana I once
knew has grown so much.[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Y-you think so? Tell me,
how have I changed?[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]You're so serious now. This war[.]
has made you serious.[.][A]
You're not the same princess
I remember from my youth.[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I know that I've lived a sheltered
life being the princess.[A]
I know that I've taken my family's
wealth for granted.[.][A]
When I saw what the war had done to[.]
the people of Renais and Frelia,[A]
I knew that I needed to do something
to change things.[.][A]
[ToggleSmile]And you know what? You taught me
something I never forgot.[.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]I did?[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Yes, that's right.[A]
Your strength and pride[.]
as a pegasus knight.[A]
Your graciousness and[.]
kindness as a human being.[A]
Your example is a lesson that[.]
has stuck with me, Syrene.[A][OpenMidRight]I'm honored to hear that I've[.]
had such an impact on you.[A]
You truly are a kind lady.[A]
Serving the Frelian royal house[.]
has been my greatest joy.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]There's[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]another lesson I was
hoping you could teach me.[A][OpenMidRight]If I can help, I would be glad to.[A][OpenMidLeft]I'd like you to teach me[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]cooking.[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I can make some traditional Frelian[.]
dishes, but I'm no gourmet chef[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[ToggleSmile]But if you don't mind, then I'd be
happy to teach you what I know.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Thank you! When I return home to
Frelia after this war is over,[A]
I hope to cook my parents a proper
meal to apologize for running off.[A][OpenMidRight]I'm sure they'll be surprised to see
how much you've grown out here.[.][A]
Surprised and pleased. They'll certainly
forgive you for going off on your own.[A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Sometimes, I wonder[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove] I do[.]
hope that they forgive me.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]Of course they will. They're angry
because they're concerned.[A]
If you return safely, they will[.]
be relieved, not upset.[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]You're right[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
[ToggleSmile]Thank you, Syrene.[A]
But it can't hurt to ease their[.]
anger with some good food![A][OpenMidRight]Right you are, milady. I'll teach[.]
you everything I know about food.[.][A]
[0D09]
[ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x12C][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x12B][OpenMidRight]That food you made the other night was
fabulous. The soldiers told me about it.[A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Really? [ToggleSmile]They were talking about[.]
my food? I was so nervous.[A][OpenMidRight]You've learned the basics well. That's
a solid foundation for all Frelian food.[A]
Take care of yourself, milady.[A]
I look forward to hearing how your
parents respond to your cooking.[A][OpenMidLeft]You take care of yourself, too, Syrene.[.]
It's your duty to protect me, right?[A]
Then I want you to fulfill your duty
and promise to go home with me![.][A][OpenMidRight]I shall do what I can.[A]
[ToggleSmile]But the battlefield can be a
dangerous place, milady.[A]
If something happens to me, see to
it that you return home safely.[.][A][ToggleSmile][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Syrene[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft][MoveLeft][OpenLeft]You're like a real sister to me.
I've always admired you.[A]
You've taught me so much already,[.][A]
and there's so much more that I[.]
can learn from you[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenLeft][MoveLeft][OpenLeft]So you can't die. You have to come
back home to Frelia with me.[A]
No matter what.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Princess Tana[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight][MoveRight][OpenRight]I shall never leave your side, milady.[....]
But if something should happen to me[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
If, perchance, I were to[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]to die,[.]
I would die happy knowing you were safe.[A]
[ToggleSmile]Please, don't waste my sacrifice.[.]
Make it home, safe, alive, and well.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenLeft][ToggleSmile]I will. I promise.
[ToggleSmile]But you have to promise me[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
Promise that you will do everything[.]
in your power to return home with me.[.][A][OpenRight][ToggleSmile]I will, Princess Tana. We will
return to Frelia together. I promise.[.][A][ToggleSmile]
[0D0A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x12C][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x113][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Hello, Sir Cormag.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]Princess Tana![A]
That still sounds so odd to me. You know,[.]
I had no idea you were a princess at first.[.][A]
But please, just call me Cormag. There's
no need for honorifics with me.[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Cormag it is, then. I had[.]
a favor to ask of you.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]What would you have me do, Princess?[A][OpenMidLeft]I'm prone to attacks from archers[.]
when I'm on the battlefield[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]That makes two of us.[.][A]
It's a common problem for[.]
airborne soldiers.[A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I thought perhaps we could keep watch[.]
for archers and warn one another.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]Hm. Yes, you've got a good idea[.]
there. A [OpenQuote]buddy system[CloseQuote] of sorts.[.][A]
But if you saw an ally in danger, you'd[.]
warn him regardless, wouldn't you?[A][OpenMidLeft]Well, of course! But we're so high
up that I was worried[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
If I saw an archer, I didn't think
my voice would carry to you in time.[A]
[ToggleSmile]Perhaps the neighing of a pegasus or
the cries of a wyvern could carry[.][A]
far enough to warn the others.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]Oh! I see[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove] Yes, we might not be able
to hear each other in the heat of battle.[.][A]
But our steeds can be louder than[.]
either of us could.[.][A]
[ToggleSmile]And trust me, my wyvern's shriek can
pierce your ear from two leagues away.[A]
[ToggleSmile]A brilliant idea, Your Highness.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Really?[.]
Thank you.[A][OpenMidRight]Right, so if we see anything out there,[.]
we'll have our mounts call out, right?[A][OpenMidLeft]Yes, and thank you, Cormag.[.][A]
[0D0B]
[ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x12C][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x113][OpenMidLeft]Cormag, thanks for warning me about[.]
that archer the other day.[A]
Your wyvern startled me, but I think
you may have saved my life![.][A][OpenMidRight]Well, you should thank him, then.[.]
I can't take credit for it.[.][A]
I mean, he started shrieking out to[.]
you before I even saw that bowman.[A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Really?[.][....]
That's amazing[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[ToggleSmile]In that case[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][CloseSpeechSlow][.....][OpenMidLeft][MoveLeft][OpenLeft][ToggleSmile][.....]Thank you.[A][ToggleSmile][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]The bond between a wyvern and rider[.]
is close, and this guy's a smart one.[.][A]
I'm sure you and your pegasus[.]
are the same, wouldn't you say?[.][A][OpenLeft]Oh, yes. It's the same with every[.]
knight and her pegasus.[.][A]
It's so sad to see how war has changed
the way we relate to our animal allies.[.][A]
It's taking such a tremendous toll
on these beautiful creatures.[.][A][OpenMidRight]I agree. This whole war is ludicrous.[.][A]
War itself is madness, even more so if
it's for greed or the fantasy of power.[.][A][OpenLeft]I hope our efforts end this war quickly.
I don't want to see anyone else die.[A][OpenMidRight]Nor do I. But you cannot race[.]
headlong into battle.[.][A]
We'll need you to help rebuild
our shattered nations, after all.[.][A]
We soldiers are expendable, but[.]
you regal types aren't.[.][A][OpenLeft][MoveLeft][OpenLeft]Cormag, don't say that![.][A][OpenMidRight]But it's true.[A][OpenLeft]No! No life is expendable![A][OpenMidRight]Your Highness[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenLeft]Don't throw your life away.[.]
[ToggleSmile]Promise me, will you?[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
As you wish, Princess.
I'll be careful.[A][OpenLeft][ToggleSmile]I have your promise, Cormag.[A][ToggleSmile]
[0D0C]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x12C][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x113][OpenMidLeft]What are you fighting for, Cormag?[A][OpenMidRight]What makes you ask?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]I saw you fighting earlier[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
and for some reason, it made me sad.[A][OpenMidRight]I see. I can think of many reasons
why a man would fight.[A]
Atonement, revenge, entertainment[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
For power[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove] For fun[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][A]
But I don't know the reason[.]
I am fighting anymore.[A][ToggleMouthMove][OpenMidLeft]Cormag[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]What more would you expect from a[.]
man who's lost his faith?[.][A]
A man whose emperor has gone mad,[.]
whose homeland is collapsing?[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
What are you going to do
when the war is over?[.][A][OpenMidRight]I'll help rebuild Grado, of course,[.]
but I'm not sure beyond that.[.][A]
I doubt that I'll remain in Grado[.]
for long, though.[.][A]
They've branded me a traitor. I'll
find no home awaiting me there.[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Then why don't you come to Frelia?
You can join us as an airborne knight![A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]And what makes you think a traitor
like me would be welcomed in Frelia?[A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]You're no traitor, Cormag. You've[.]
stayed true to your beliefs.[A]
[ToggleSmile]That sadness I saw in you comes from your[.]
own country's betrayal of those beliefs.[A]
Your sadness runs as deep as your[.]
faith in Grado once ran.[A]
[ToggleSmile]I want your faith, your strength, and[.]
your passion to serve Frelia now.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]I appreciate the offer, but I cannot
reforge the oaths I've broken.[A]
[ToggleSmile]I'm sorry.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]It's all right.[.][.....]
I understand your feelings.[.][A]
[ToggleSmile]However, if you ever wish to serve
your beliefs again, remember my offer.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I might just give up this soldiering
nonsense and go into woodworking.[.][A][ToggleSmile][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Then I'll track you down in[.]
your woodshop and ask again.[A][OpenMidRight]You may not look it, but you're[.]
pretty strong willed for a princess.[A]
I'll think about your offer.[A]
[0D0D]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x12C][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x10F][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Innes![A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]Tana[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I'm so glad to find you safe![.]
Everyone back home is worried.[A]
Don't you worry, though. I'll[.]
protect you from now on.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
Tana, what are you doing here? You
have no place on the battlefield.[.][A]
I want you to return to Castle
Frelia immediately.[.][A][OpenMidLeft][MoveMidLeft][OpenMidLeft]Why does everyone say that!?[A]
I am one of Frelia's pegasus
knights and a trained soldier![A]
I studied with Syrene and Vanessa,
two of Frelia's finest![.][A][OpenMidRight]And you're also a Frelian princess.[.][A]
You should not be fighting. What
would happen if you were injured?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]No! I'm not going back![.][A][OpenMidRight]Tana![.][A][OpenMidLeft][MoveMidLeft][OpenMidLeft]I won't go back![A][OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidRight]Why does she always[.]
have to be like this?[.][A]
[0D0E]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x12C][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x10F][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Did you see me out on[.]
the battlefield, Innes?[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I knew I made the right decision,[.]
coming out here.[A]
I feel like our strategy is becoming
much better, as is our fighting.[A]
You do agree, don't you, Innes?[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]I grant you some small credit for your
achievements on the field of war.[.][A]
However, I still insist that you
return to Frelia.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Why!?[.][A][OpenMidRight]It's true that you've gained some[.]
experience out on the battlefield.[A]
But your ignorance of the world[.]
around you is simply appalling.[.][A]
It must be tough for a pampered castle
brat like you to interact with soldiers.[A][OpenMidLeft]If you can say something like that to your
own sister, I'm more worried about you.[.][A]
Even when you're right--and your
judgment is good, I know--[A]
you're so blunt that I don't think many[.]
people will want to listen to you.[A][OpenMidRight]Never mind about me. This is
about you, Tana.[A]
If you keep traveling with us, someone
might take advantage of your naivet[.]é.[.][A]
More than anything, I can't allow[.]
that Ephraim to--[.][A][OpenMidLeft]What are you saying? Do you[.]
really think Ephraim and I--[A][OpenMidRight]No. Even if you're not interested[.]
in him in the slightest, I[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
I simply do not want to see[.]
you get hurt.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Innes, what are you suggesting?[.][A]
If that's the way you're going to[.]
be, I just won't talk to you anymore![.][A][OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidRight]Tana, wait. I'm not finished![.][A][.....]
Blast[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[0D0F]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x12C][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x10F][OpenMidLeft][MoveMidLeft][OpenMidLeft][MoveMidLeft][OpenMidLeft]Oh, Innes!
Why can't you understand!?[A][OpenMidRight]Why can't you listen to your brother?[.]
Why are you always so stubborn!?[A][OpenMidLeft]You're the stubborn one, Innes![.]
Why can't you understand how I feel?[A]
You're my only brother, and I have
no one else on whom I can rely[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
I don't want to waste our time
together arguing![.][A][OpenMidRight]Tana[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]You don't know how much I envy Eirika[.]
and Ephraim their closeness.[A]
They understand one another's thoughts
and feelings perfectly all the time![A]
Why aren't we like that? Why do you[.]
never understand me, Innes?[.][A][OpenMidRight]Tana, wait.[.][A]
I don't say these things
because I hate you.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]That's a lie! You're always so
mean to me, Innes![A]
You make no effort to understand
how I feel.[.][A][OpenMidRight]That's not true.[A]
I'm still your brother, and I think[.]
I know you better than anyone else.[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]Do you mean that, Innes?[A][OpenMidRight]Absolutely.[.][A]
Do you remember the incident
with the crown?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Hm[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][.....]
Oh![.][A][Clear]
I remember. It was when I was very
little, and I lost Father's crown.[A]
He was so angry with me. I thought
he would never stop yelling.[A]
I was so terrified of his wrath, and
I just couldn't stop crying.[A]
[ToggleSmile]I honestly believed Father would
throw me in the dungeon![A]
But you searched the castle from top
to bottom, and you found the crown.[.][A]
And I remember what you told Father[.]
when you brought it back to him:[A]
[OpenQuote]I took your crown, Father. I wanted to[.]
see what it would look like on my head.[CloseQuote][A]
I remember how happy I was when I heard[.]
Father laughing at your words.[A]
I thought I was the luckiest girl in
the world to have a brother like you.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I know how you feel better
than anyone else.[.][A]
And that's no lie.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Innes[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[ToggleSmile]I understand now why you
said what you said.[.][A]
[ToggleSmile]But please, forgive me for
being here, for not going home.[.][A]
I simply wanted to be near
you, my beloved brother.[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[ToggleSmile]You win. I'll let you stay.[.][A]
[ToggleSmile]But you be sure to apologize to[.]
our father when we return home.[.][A]
[ToggleSmile]And don't worry too much. I'll be[.]
there with you when you do.[.][A][ToggleSmile][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Really?[.]
I love you, Innes![A]
[OpenMidLeft][MoveLeft][OpenLeft]You're the best brother[.]
anyone could have![A][OpenMidRight]And you are quite[.]
a handful, Sister.[A]
[0D10]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x12C][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x11E][OpenMidLeft]Oh! You're one of Gerik's[.]
mercenaries, aren't you?[A][OpenMidRight]Frelia's princess[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yes, that's right. I'm Tana.
What's your name?[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]Marisa.[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Nice to meet you, Marisa![.][A]
I just wanted to tell you how[.]
much I appreciate you all.[A]
Mercenaries, I mean. It's because[.]
of you that we're doing so well.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]It's my job, and I'm doing it.
No need to thank me.[A][OpenMidLeft]But I'd always heard mercenaries were[.]
renegades, cutthroats, and oath breakers.[.][A]
[ToggleSmile]You're nothing like that, though.[.][A]
So that's why I wanted to thank[.]
you--for fighting so hard for us.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]It's not out of loyalty to you
or to any kingdom.[A]
I'm happy as long as I have a[.]
chance to swing my sword.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Oh[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove] Is that so[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[ToggleSmile]But it doesn't matter to me![A]
You're helping us now, and I
know you'd never betray us.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]I don't care what you think.[A][OpenMidRight][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft]But-but[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove] Oh, wait![A][Clear]
Well[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove] She doesn't talk[.]
much, does she[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[0D11]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x12C][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x11E][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Oh, Marisa.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]What is it?[.][....] What's the matter?[.][.....]
[ToggleSmile]Oh! Have you never seen a pegasus?[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]Magnificent.[A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Is this your first time ever
seeing a pegasus up close?[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]Yes.[A]
I've fought beside pegasus knights,[.]
but I've never been this close before.[A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Well?[.][....] What do you think?[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
I thought they would have more delicate[.]
legs, because they fly so much.[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Oh, they can gallop quite quickly.
They don't always have to fly.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]Interesting.
[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
It is truly magnificent.
Powerful and beautiful.[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Would you like to touch him?
Pet his head. Achaeus likes that.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]Touch[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]him?[A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Of course. Be my guest.[.]
Unless you're[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]scared?[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]I'm not scared.[.][A]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]Very well.[A]
[CloseSpeechSlow][OpenMidRight][MoveRight][.....][OpenRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]That's it[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
[ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
See?
He is happy.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenRight]Your pegasus is named[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]Achaeus[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][.....]
That is a good name. A strong name.[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Thanks.[.][A]
Syrene named him. She's a pegasus[.]
knight. She's sort of my mentor.[A]
Someday, I want to be as graceful[.]
and strong as Syrene.[.][A]
And then, like Syrene, I'll pass my[.]
experiences on to the next generation.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenRight]I see. I have no goal but[.]
to master my swordsmanship.[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Oh, but that's a fine dream! Then[.]
let's keep working, shall we?[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]Yes.[A]
[0D12]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x12C][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x11E][OpenMidLeft]Marisa, is it difficult to
improve your swordsmanship?[.][A][OpenMidRight]It is.[A]
I practice daily. I've fought a[.]
thousand men and won each time.[.][A]
And still, I have seen only the barest
glimpse of what I could achieve.[A][OpenMidLeft]Really[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[ToggleSmile]Maybe you shouldn't press[.]
yourself so hard.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I can see how dedicated you are[.]
to becoming a better swordfighter.[A]
But if you focus too much on a lofty goal,
you might not notice when you reach it.[.][A]
And I have no doubt you will reach it.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]What is it, Marisa?[.][A][OpenMidRight]Why do you waste your time
speaking with me, Princess?[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Oh, am I not supposed to do that?[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]It's not a matter of whether
you should or should not.[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]At first, I thought you were brusque
and[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]maybe a little intimidating, too.[.][A]
But you're not like that at all. You're[.]
just shy--and a poor conversationalist.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]A poor--[.....] You know, many of my[.]
fellow swordsmen still fear me.[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I'm sure they do. Your grace with[.]
the sword is something else.[A]
But when you're not fighting, you're
completely different. More pensive.[.][A]
You're so dedicated to your goal. You[.]
have that far-off look in your eyes,[A]
like you're lost in thoughts of love
or something like that.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]You've already made up your mind, Princess,[.]
so there's no point in my arguing.[A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Then we agree! Oh, but there's
one more thing.[.][A]
Just call me Tana. You don't have[.]
to keep calling me [OpenQuote]Princess.[CloseQuote][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]Why?[A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]We're friends now.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]Friends?[A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]That's right! So just call me Tana.[.][A]
I don't want you to worry about royal[.]
titles and formality when we talk.[A]
You say you've dedicated yourself to
the sword, but[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
that doesn't mean you can't have
a friend or two, does it?[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][.....]
[ToggleSmile]Well, Marisa?[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][.....]
No, that doesn't sound[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]bad.[A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Great! Boy, I don't know what I would[.]
have done if you'd said no.[.][A]
But there it is. We're friends
now, right, Marisa?[.][A][ToggleSmile][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]As you say, Tana.[.][A]
[0D13]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x10F][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x11B][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Hey, Prince!
How's it going?[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Gerik[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
I'm sorry you had to see
that ugly side of me.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Huh? What do you mean?[A][OpenMidLeft]At Renvall, when you stayed by me.[A]
If not for your loyalty, I would have fallen
into the hands of those mercenaries.[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Ah, well, that's my job, innit?[.][A]
But what's your point? This[.]
is unlike you, Prince.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]I've guided men into battle countless[.]
times before that day.[A]
I've always tried to be a model commander,
to guide others by my example.[A]
But[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]I found that many of my soldiers
wanted a less severe example to follow.[.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Ha ha ha[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]But you're different. I've known
that from the day we first met.[.][A]
How do you stay so composed in
the heat of battle?[.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I don't know how to answer that[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
I suppose it's just in my nature.[.][A][Clear]
Long discussions on the battlefield,
however, are not. Let's go already.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Ahh[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[0D14]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x10F][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x11B][OpenMidLeft]Nice work, Gerik[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
I see the Desert Tiger is[.]
still as fierce as ever.[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I can't believe my skill with the blade[.]
is known in circles as high as yours.[.][A]
Let me tell you, I didn't get into this[.]
line of work because I like fighting.[.][A]
It was a twist of fate that started[.]
me on this path[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Really? But I've heard of your fame[.]
from no less a person than my father.[.][A]
He tells me your name was once known
from shore to shore on this continent.[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]The past is the past. I was just
doing what I had to.[A]
If I hadn't, I never would have[.]
survived.[.][A]
But there's something about combat
that just doesn't agree with my nature.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]If that's the case, why are[.]
you with these mercenaries?[.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Ahh[.][ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]The answer is so simple,
you'll probably laugh.[A]
Back when I was a kid, a friend from my[.]
village said he wanted to be a mercenary.[.][A]
He said he was going to be famous, the
greatest warrior in all the land.[.][A]
No matter how many times I told him to
give it up, he wouldn't listen to me.[.][A]
Well, one day, he left for Jehanna.[.][A]
I didn't know what else to do, so I went
with him and joined the guild, too.[.][A]
Stupid reason, isn't it? Anyway[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
I didn't particularly like fighting, and
while I wasn't opposed to the money,[A]
I certainly wasn't in it for fame[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
I just couldn't let my friend go off
and get killed.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]And where is this friend now?[.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]He went off and got killed.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]I see[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]So there was no reason for me to
continue being a mercenary[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
But then there were other men who I[.]
considered to be my friends.[A]
I couldn't bring myself to abandon them[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
And so the years passed and here I am.[A]
The thing is I can't stand to see my [.]
friends die.[A]
But if you're in this business long enough,[.]
people around you get killed. It happens.[.][A]
The only thing you can do is keep moving
forward and try not to think about it.[A]
So[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]Yes, I'd have a problem if you
got yourself killed.[A]
I've got no place else to go, and I'm tired 
of trying to forget.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Hmph[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
Do you really think I'd lose so easily?[.][A]
It won't do for you to underestimate me.[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Oh, uh[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]Right.[A][ToggleSmile]
[0D15]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x10F][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x11B][OpenMidLeft]Gerik.[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Eh?[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]There's something I've always assumed[.]
to be true[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
Those born to royalty cannot show[.]
others any weaknesses or deficiencies.[A]
If they're not perfect at all times, their
enemies will take advantage of them.[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yeah? So?[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]But meeting you has made me rethink[.]
that belief.[A]
My father told me before I left that
I should watch you and learn from you.[A]
At the time, I believed there was[.]
nothing a mercenary could teach me.[.][A]
Now I know better. I am thankful to both
my father and you.[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]That's enough of that. In my opinion,[.]
you're much finer than I could ever be.[.][A]
The way you live, your manners, and your
bearing[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove] I could never pull it off.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Me? What do you mean?[.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Look at you! You're full of confidence.[.]
You've got pride.[.][A]
When I first met you, I thought,
[OpenQuote]What a high-handed dandy.[CloseQuote] [A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Did you just call me[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]a dandy?[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]But that's just who you are.[A]
Being proud is not always[.]
a bad thing.[A]
You must have worked yourself near to[.]
death to preserve that pride.[.][A]
What I mean is that you never make
excuses for losing or being beaten up.[A]
No matter the pain you face or hardship, [.]
you keep on fighting to honor that pride.[.][A]
It's what defines you, and I can't
say that I don't admire it.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]It comes naturally.[.][A]
I will be king one day, and I will make[.]
Frelia the greatest nation in all the world.[A]
It will be a wonderful kingdom of wealth [.]
and power.[A]
When that day comes, I will command you[.]
to become general and lead Frelia's armies.[.][A]
[ToggleSmile]No, I'll have you come and ask me to
make you general.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Ha ha ha! I can't wait![.][A][ToggleSmile]
[0D16]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x10F][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x122][OpenMidRight]Well, hello.[A][OpenMidLeft]Imagine meeting you here.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Yes[.][ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]You know, I believe this is[.]
our first chance to speak privately.[A]
I am L'Arachel of the Theocracy of Rausten.[.]
It's a pleasure to meet you.[A][OpenMidLeft]I believe you already know my name.[.][A]
I am Innes, prince of Frelia.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Speaking of Frelia[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]Oh, I remember,[.]
the seafood was delicious there.[A][OpenMidLeft]Yes. I would agree that the fish of[.]
my homeland is not unpleasant.[A][OpenMidRight]Yes.[A]
[ToggleSmile]However it does not compare with
that of my home, Rausten.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Is that so?[.][A]
I know not what fish your country[.]
has to offer, but I have a hard time[A]
imagining they could be that much[.]
tastier than our own.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Your doubt is not surprising.[.][A]
Once this war is over, you must[.]
come and visit Rausten.[.][A]
I think it best if you try a wide[.]
variety of our fish for yourself.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]That's a good idea.[.]
I will most certainly do so.[A]
And perhaps you have not tasted[.]
all the fish Frelia has to offer.[.][A]
To be sure, you should visit again.[.]
Perhaps a culinary exchange is in order.[A]
[ToggleSmile]It may be you change your opinion.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]We'll see.[......]
Very well, I accept your invitation.[A]
I will visit your country once more[.]
and taste your national dishes.[.][A]
[0D17]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x10F][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x122][OpenMidLeft]L'Arachel.[A][OpenMidRight]Yes?[A][OpenMidLeft]Are you sure you're supposed
to be here?[.][A]
I wonder if you're truly here with the
permission of your superiors.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Of-of course I am![A]
What gives you the right to speak[.]
to me in such a manner?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Well, I have heard a bit about
your wild behavior[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]H-how rude you are![.][A]
If I were not a holy woman, I[.]
would beat you senseless.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]How savage YOU are.[.][A]
Perhaps you could learn self-control by[.]
observing Frelia's pegasus knights.[.][A]
[ToggleSmile]Yes, there's something I'd like to show you.[A]
When the Frelia's pegasi gather[.]
in Walles Forest[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
It's a spectacle of such beauty[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]If it is beauty you seek, then
Rausten is second to none.[A]
Do you know of Rausten's lofty
peak Mount Mimir.[.][A]
[ToggleSmile]I pity those who die without having[.]
gazed upon its breathtaking beauty.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
If you recommend it so highly, then[.]
yes, I would indeed like to see it.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Yes. That would be splendid[.]
indeed.[.][A]
But there are many more equally[.]
beautiful places in Rausten.[A][OpenMidLeft]Then perhaps you should tell me[.]
about them for future reference.[A]
And in return, I shall take time to tell you
about the beautiful places in my kingdom.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Yes, I would love to hear more.[.][A]
[0D18]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x10F][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x122][OpenMidLeft]The Theocracy of Rausten certainly
sounds like a spectacular land.[.][A][OpenMidRight]As does Frelia, much more[.]
than I imagined it would.[.][A]
And yet[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]You mean to ask which is the
more spectacular? Is that it?[.][A][OpenMidRight]What? That's no question at all!
Rausten is clearly superior in every way.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]I expected you would say so.[A]
But what of the truth?
Your opinion is subjective, is it not?[A][OpenMidRight]Well[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]um[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
All opinions are subjective,[A]
but I'm sure an objective evaluation
would yield the same result.[A][OpenMidLeft]To prove that, we will need some
fair and impartial third in our discussion.[.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Indeed! And I have
a splendid idea.[A]
Let the pair from Renais judge.[.][A]
Surely Ephraim and Eirika can come to[.]
a proper decision.[A][ToggleSmile][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Of course. I agree completely.[A]
I think I should remind the two of all
the wonder Frelia holds.[A][OpenMidRight]Then it's decided.[A]
They will visit both of our homes, and
we'll show them such splendor as to[.][A]
leave them breathless.[A]
Invitations to tour our two nations[.]
will surely have them overjoyed.[A][OpenMidLeft]It would only be natural.[.][A][OpenMidRight]It would be natural.[A]
Very well then. Let us deal with this[.]
evil and take those two home with us.[.][A]
First and foremost, it is a competition[.]
to see whose land is more magnificent![A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I can see this whole affair has[.]
you very enthralled.[A]
I cannot say where this little
competition will lead us[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[ToggleSmile]But I am more than happy to go
up against you.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Don't blame me if you regret
our contest later, though.[A]
You may be composed before others, but
you'll surely be lonely on your own.[A][OpenMidLeft]Be warned yourself. Your words here may[.]
prove embarrassing to you later.[A][OpenMidRight]It's not a problem.[.][A]
This is just another contest
in the name of all that is holy and true.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Ah, very well then.[.][A]
[0D19]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x11C][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x11B][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Tethys.[.]
How are you feeling?[A][ToggleSmile][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Oh, Chief. Things are as fine[.]
as one could expect.[A]
But I've been dancing so much[.]
I've worked up quite a sweat.[.][A]
At this rate I may even lose a few
inches off of my waistline.[.][A]
Who knows, maybe my figure will be
even more alluring than before.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Ha ha ha! Well, I'm not sure that's even
possible, but keep up the good work.[A]
Your dancing has had quite a restorative [.]
effect on the troops.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Really? I'm happy to hear it. I[.]
must keep dancing then, mustn't I?[A][Clear]
Oh, I almost forgot, Chief.[.][A]
I have good news, and then I have[.]
better news.[A][OpenMidRight]What's the good news?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]I hear today's meal is one of[.]
your favorites, herbed stew.[A][OpenMidRight]Oh, that is good news! It's been quite
a while since I've had any.[.][A]
And the even better news?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]In this next battle, you'll get your hands
on some sort of an incredible treasure.[.][A][OpenMidRight]A treasure?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Yes, that's right, some sort of treasure.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Ha ha ha! I see. I don't know what it[.]
might be, but I can't wait for it.[A]
Nor for today's meal.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]I'm going to continue dancing a bit longer
so as to work up a healthy appetite.[A][OpenMidRight]So tell me, Tethys, when did
you first start dancing?[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Oh[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
Well, that would have been[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]Hm?[.][......]
What's the matter?[A][OpenMidLeft]Um, well[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[ToggleSmile]Yes, it was long ago.[.]
Back when Ewan was still young.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]What is it, Tethys?[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]I'm sorry, Chief. I'll explain  it [.]
another time. Can we drop it for now?[.][A][OpenMidRight]Tethys[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[0D1A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x11C][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x11B][OpenMidLeft]Chief.[A]
The truth is, Ewan and I? We were[.]
abandoned by our parents.[.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][.....]
Oh, I see[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]Um[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
I wandered about with little Ewan in tow.[.]
He had no idea what was happening.[A]
I was a child myself with no job.[.][A]
We went to bed hungry every night,
and our clothes were rags[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Then one day I said to myself,
[OpenQuote]We cannot go on like this![CloseQuote][A]
I watched a dancer on a street corner[.]
and memorized all of her moves.[.][A]
I wasn't a very coordinated child and[.]
it was so difficult.[A]
I didn't have real shoes, so my feet
were a mess of blisters,[A]
and I fell so many times I was covered
in cuts and bruises.[A]
It was painful. And miserable. And
very, very difficult. But I never cried.[A]
Because if were to cry, he would cry.[.]
And I loved seeing Ewan's smiling face.[.][A]
I wanted him to smile all the time,[.]
so I worked hard so he could.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]Tethys[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Tee hee hee. What a sad and[.]
miserable tale. I'm sorry.[A]
I was reminded of it all just recently,[.]
and I was overcome with emotion[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
But that's how I earned the dancing skills
and physique I have now![A]
All of the hard work I did back then [.]
has made me the woman I am today.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft][Wink][.....][OpenMidLeft][OpenEyes][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleSmile]What do you say to that?[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]I'm not sure what to say.[.][A]
So before you met up with us, the two of you
had a rough time of it, did you?[A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]OK, that's enough. The past is the past!
You mustn't tell anyone about this.[.][A]
I don't share this story with others.[.]
I only told you because you're the chief.[.][A]
A story of toil and hardship doesn't quite [.]
fit my mysterious image, does it?[.][A][Clear]
You know what I'd like?[.][.....]
For you to tell me more about you.[A][ToggleSmile][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]Sure. Another time, though, OK?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]All right. Let's see this[.]
thing through to the end.[.][A]
If we do our best, good things will come
of it. And then better things after that.[.][A]
Right, Chief?[.][A][OpenMidRight]Right, Tethys. You be careful.[A][OpenMidLeft]Of course! And you too, Chief![A]
[0D1B]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x11B][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x11C][OpenMidRight]Um, Chief, there's actually one[.]
thing I've been wanting to ask you.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]And what's that?[A][OpenMidRight]Sorry if this brings up any bad memories, but[.]
how'd you get that scar on your face?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]This?[.][A]
I got this beauty when I had
just started out as a mercenary.[A][Clear]
I was still a novice, but I was feeling[.]
pretty good about my swordsmanship.[.][A]
I got to a point where I was arrogant[.]
enough to believe no one could best me.[.][A]
Then one day it happened[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]It's something
I've never been able to forget.[.][A][OpenMidRight]What happened?[A][OpenMidLeft]It was just another battle. I'd been hired
on as another sword and then I met him.[.][A]
He was a knight from some country[.]
or another.[.][A]
I had fought knights on several other[.]
occasions and had beaten them all.[A]
Even though he was a bit tougher,[.]
I was sure I'd defeat him in the end.[.][A]
That's what I thought.[A]
But[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][Clear]
His strength was beyond me. I may as well 
have been using a broomstick to fight.[A]
I remember thinking, [OpenQuote]What a tiny little
world I've been living in.[CloseQuote][.][A]
He crushed me effortlessly, and the wound[.]
he inflicted became this lovely scar.[.][A][OpenMidRight]I see[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]I was truly frightened. It was the first
time I'd experienced fear as a mercenary.[.][A]
So this knight saw how scared I was[.]
and said, [OpenQuote]Go.[CloseQuote][.][A]
He didn't kill me.
He let me escape.[.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]I was humiliated and ashamed.[.][A]
My eyes were finally opened to [.]
my own weakness.[A]
It goes without saying I lost every[.]
shred of self-confidence.[.][A][Clear]
[.....]I still dream about it sometimes.[.]
It wakes me up every time.[A]
I've never forgotten that knight.[.]
He thought I was weak and pathetic.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Chief[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]I was young and stupid.[.]
This scar is my punishment.[.][A][OpenMidRight]But that knight[.]
spared your life.[.][A]
Because of that, good things and
better things have happened?[A][OpenMidLeft]What do you mean, Tethys?[.][A][OpenMidRight]First of all, Chief, you're alive.[A]
If you had died, all the good times[.]
you've had since that day,[A]
and all the joy you're sure to have[.]
from this day onward, wouldn't exist.[.][A]
And another thing, because you lived, you[.]
made many friends and you met me.[.][A]
I also don't think that knight thought
you were pathetic.[A]
I think he saw a young man with his whole[.]
life ahead of him.[A]
That's why he let you go.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Tethys[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]Yep. [.][.....]I'm sure that's it. So try
thinking about it in a more positive light.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Ha ha ha. [....]You're right.[.]
I was a lot calmer after that.[A]
And while I've had hard times,
there've been far more good times.[A]
I guess you could say I owe my success
as a mercenary to that knight.[A][OpenMidRight]Yep.
You've got your knight,[.][A]
and I've got my dancer. Thanks to the[.]
two of them, the two of us are here now.[A]
Say, Chief, why don't we become like them?[A]
I think we should work at being[.]
inspirations to other people.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Hm[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]good idea.[A][Clear]
Thanks, Tethys.[.]
I think I'll sleep soundly tonight.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Good.[.][.....]
You know, Chief, I'm really happy.[A][OpenMidLeft]Yeah, me, too. I've got a life I enjoy [.]
and good companions.[A]
All that and a wonderful woman to love.[.]
Everyone should be so lucky.[A][OpenMidRight]Oh![.][.....] Chief![.][A][CloseSpeechSlow][OpenMidRight][MoveLeft][OpenMidLeft][MoveFarLeft][SendToBack][OpenLeft][CloseEyes][OpenFarLeft]Whoa![.][......]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenFarLeft][HalfCloseEyes][OpenFarLeft]Hey now[.][ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]This is a battlefield.
This isn't the place for that[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenLeft]No one's looking[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenFarLeft]Um[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
[OpenFarLeft][CloseEyes][OpenFarLeft]Oh, all right[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][.......]
[0D1C]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x11B][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x11E][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Hello, Marisa.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]Chief.[A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]How're you doing? Your sword still sharp?[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]Same as always.[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]You're not seriously injured
or ill, are you?[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]No.[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I see.
So you can continue on?[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]Yes. Why all the questions?[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Oh.[.][A]
I'm the commander, you know? I'm supposed[.]
to check on you now and then.[.][A]
Well, see you later.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]Wait.[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Hm?[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]I'd like you to keep talking.[.][A]
I don't mind talking to you.[A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]You know, we've known each other for a
long time, so I understand you[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
But listen, Marisa, it wouldn't hurt
you to be a bit more sociable.[A]
Not for me, mind you, but some of the[.]
others have a hard time working with you.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Speaking of which, when I first met[.]
you, you were always working alone.[.][A]
I remember thinking how odd that was.[.][A]
I figured a woman as beautiful and talented[.]
as you would have men all around her.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]Don't need 'em.[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]You see, that's what I'm talking about![.]
Your beauty belies your words.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]Chief?[A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Hm?[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]Do you like sociable women?[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Um[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]sure, I guess.
I mean, doesn't everyone?[.][A]
If you go to an inn, aren't the[.]
sociable gals the most popular?[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]I understand.[.]
OK. I'll be more sociable.[A]
[ToggleSmile]This better?[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Huh?![.][A][ToggleSmile]
[0D1D]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x11E][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x11B][OpenMidRight]Say, Marisa.[A][OpenMidLeft]Hello.[A][OpenMidRight]Listen, you've been acting
a bit odd lately.[.][A]
You don't talk to me as[.]
much as you used to.[A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
I'm practicing.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Practicing?[.]
Practicing what?[A][OpenMidLeft]Being sociable.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Oh[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[ToggleSmile]Because it's you I'm going
to assume that you're serious.[A]
You know what I said before? I wasn't[.]
really serious, so don't worry about it.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]But.[A]
I've practiced.[.][A]
I'm a bit more sociable.[A][OpenMidRight]In what way?
You don't appear to have changed at all.[A][OpenMidLeft]You're wrong.[.]
Let me show you.[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]What? You're going to be sociable?
This I've got to see.[.][A]
Well, go ahead.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]You won't laugh, will you?[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]No, I won't laugh.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Truly?[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes, I promise.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Here goes[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][Clear]
[ToggleSmile]Hello, Gerik![.]
Wonderful day for a battle, isn't it![.][......][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]Why are you looking away?[.][A][OpenMidRight]N-n-no[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]reason[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][......]
[ToggleSmile]Mmha[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
Bwa ha ha ha ha![A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Oh![.][.....][A]
[0D1E]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x11E][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x11B][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]C'mon, Marisa, don't be like that.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I'm sorry, I didn't mean to laugh.
Are you still mad?[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]I'm mad.[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Forgive me.[.]
I really and truly apologize.[.][A]
Still mad?[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]I'm still mad.[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Sigh. OK, I get it.[.][A]
What do I have to do to[.]
get you to forgive me?[A]
I don't have much gold, but I[.]
could get you a snack[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]You're the chief.[.][A]
You don't have to apologize.[A]
Just give orders.[.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Well, I know, but I was[.]
wrong. I was the bad guy.[.][A]
My crime was not being sensitive
to your feelings.[.][A]
I tell you what, I'll buy[.]
you anything you want.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]You're soft.[A]
Leaders are normally
harsher than you.[.][A]
You're too nice.
Too nice to all of us.[A]
That's why[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]That's why what?[A][OpenMidLeft]Nothing.[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Well, I said too much and I'm sorry.
You're fine just the way you are.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Really?[.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yeah, of course.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Th-then[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
If you would[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
I wouldn't be mad anymore.[A][OpenMidRight]Hm?[.][.....]
What did you say?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Nothing. Forget it.[.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]C'mon, it wasn't nothing.[.][A]
If it'll put you in a better
mood, I don't have a problem with[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Forget it![A]
[0D1F]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x120][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x11B][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Hello, Saleh![.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Gerik[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Imagine! You and me fighting together.
Life's full of surprises, isn't it?[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]I suppose so.[.][A][OpenMidRight]So, what do you think of our commander?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]I'm here.[.]
There's your answer.[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Good point.[.][A]
You know this job seems to have more
meaning than any of my previous ones.[.][A]
And it's not because it deals with the
continent and all the nations and all that.[.][A]
I simply want to accomplish my employer's[.]
goals. That's my prime motivation.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]I think it will all work out.[.]
As long as you and I are here[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Ha ha ha! Well said.
No one can touch us, is that it?[A]
I do imagine with us in the field[.]
we'll win most battles, eh?[.][A]
Can't get overconfident, though.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Mm.[.][A]
[ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]Huh?
What is it?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Gerik[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
Do you[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]Do I what?[A][OpenMidLeft]Nothing[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
Pay me no mind.[.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]C'mon, now.[.]
What is it?[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Forgive me.[.]
It's nothing[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]All right[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][.....]
[ToggleSmile]Well then, let's get going.[.][A]
When there's a break in the fighting,[.]
we should get together for a meal.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Very well.[A]
We'll eat to our mutual good fortune[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes, to luck![.][A][ToggleSmile]
[0D20]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x11B][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x120][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Tell me, Saleh, how fares the elder?[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]She hasn't changed a bit.[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Is that so?[.][A]
[ToggleSmile]You know I was so surprised the[.]
first time I visited Caer Pelyn.[A]
The elder's eyes[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]they were not the[.]
eyes of your average person.[A]
They were filled with a lifetime's wisdom[.]
and seemed to look right through you.[.][A]
Deep[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]and sharp.
And they were so clear.[.][A]
I've looked into the eyes of many people,[.]
but no one had eyes like hers.[A]
But the thing about the elder is that[.]
her eyes weren't harsh, or judgmental.[A]
[ToggleSmile]That's what I like about her.[.][A]
Actually, when I first met her, she[.]
intimidated me.[.][A]
But she treated me with such kindness.[A]
She's why I grew to enjoy Caer Pelyn, 
even if it doesn't have any nightlife![A]
I want you to take good care of[.]
the elder, Saleh.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]Yes, I intend to.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]You say the right words, Saleh, but[.]
are you being sincerely considerate?[A][OpenMidRight]Considerate?[A]
When I'm home, I look after 
her personal belongings.[A]
I also take care of her meals and[.]
watch over her health[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]That's only natural. You have no idea[.]
what I'm talking about, do you?[.][A]
[ToggleSmile]That's just like you, though.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]Is there[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]something else
I should be doing?[A][OpenMidLeft]Next time you go home, make[.]
sure you take her a gift.[.][A]
Bring her some jewelry or something[.]
that's popular in town.[.][A][OpenMidRight]But[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][.....]
I don't know what she likes[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]Oh, please, Saleh.
That's not the issue.[.][A]
Simply receiving that sort of present[.]
from her grandson will make her happy.[A][OpenMidRight]Oh[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]is that so?[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]That's what I'm trying to tell you.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]I understand.[.]
I'll take it into consideration.[A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]When we next pass through a city,[.]
I'll help you pick something out.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]That would be helpful.[A][OpenMidLeft]Studying magic is all well and good, but you
should pay attention to these things, too.[A]
[ToggleSmile]And in your case, you need to work on[.]
understanding women's hearts.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
I'll look into it.[A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Ha ha ha.[.][....]
I'll help you out in that area, too.[A][ToggleSmile]
[0D21]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x11B][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x120][OpenMidRight]Gerik[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Hm? What is it, Saleh?
You look even more serious than usual.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]Gerik[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
You truly despise me, don't you?[A][OpenMidLeft]Huh?![.][.....]
What?[.][A][OpenMidRight]I[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]Your friend, I[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]Don't say it, Saleh![......]
That was an act of fate. Right?[.][A]
All you did was brush those sparks
away from yourself.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Gerik[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]Listen, we're mercenaries.[A]
We end up working together with old foes,[.]
and crossing blades with former allies.[.][A]
It's just part of the job.[A]
My friend Zabba died by your act.[.]
That much is true.[A]
And at that moment, I could think of [.]
nothing but avenging him![.][A]
But after that, you saved my life[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
We became friends.
That's the truth of it, isn't it?[.][A][OpenMidRight]Yes[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]I trust you now.
You are my friend.[A]
I'm not lying to you.[.]
I don't lie to my friends.[A]
That's something I don't do.[A][OpenMidRight]And you are my friend.[A]
Since that day, it's you who
has saved me time and time again.[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]We're all human after all.
Helping our friends is part of our nature.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]Gerik[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
You[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
You're a good man[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]That's enough of that! You keep that up[.]
and I'll be blushing like a schoolgirl.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Ha![.][A][ToggleSmile][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Hey! Ha ha ha! I caught a rare
glimpse of you smiling.[.][A]
Listen, Saleh, I know we're risking our lives[.]
here, but this war's not our whole lives.[.][A]
Let's not do anything stupid.[.]
We're going to get past this.[.][A]
Then you're going to haul your carcass back[.]
to Caer Pelyn and care for the elder![.][A][OpenMidRight]Yes[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
And you'll visit, too.[A][OpenMidLeft]Sure. When things calm down[.]
I'll let you throw me a feast.[A]
I can't wait to have Caer Pelyn's[.]
famous mutton stew again.[.][A][OpenMidRight]We'll be waiting for you, Gerik.[A]
[0D22]
[ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x11C][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x121][OpenMidRight]Hey, Tethys!
Check out my magic!?[A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Ewan! How many times am I going to
have to say it?[.][A]
This isn't a field trip.
Please promise me you'll behave.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]Oh, you don't have to worry about me.[.][A]
But since I'm here, I'd like to be of[.]
use. Otherwise I'm just in the way.[.][A]
You gotta let me do something.[A][OpenMidLeft]You have a point, but[.]
you're still too young.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight][MoveMidRight][OpenMidRight]Too young? I'm not a child anymore![.]
I can look after myself![A][OpenMidLeft]What are you talking about?[.]
You're not a full-fledged mage, are you?[A][OpenMidRight]Well, no, not yet. But someday I'm gonna
be one of the best mages ever![A]
These soldiers recognize my talent. That's
why I'm here on the battlefield.[A]
Just watch me! You wouldn't say that I'm
too young or inexperienced if you saw me![.][A][OpenMidRight][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][MoveLeft][OpenLeft]Wait! Ewan, wait up![A]
Oh, he's gone[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
Only a child would say something like,
[OpenQuote]Just watch me.[CloseQuote][A]
[0D23]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x121][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x11C][OpenMidLeft]Hey, Tethys. You've been getting pretty[.]
chummy with that guy lately.[A][OpenMidRight]What do you mean, Ewan?[.]
Who's [OpenQuote]that guy[CloseQuote]?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]You know, THAT guy.[.]
Look, he's right over there[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
And that guy waving his sword around[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
I'd say you've been a little too friendly[.]
with all of them![.][A][OpenMidRight]Too friendly? I wonder. I think[.]
chatting now and again is normal.[.][A]
[ToggleSmile]Wait a minute[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
Ewan, are you feeling jealous?[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft][MoveMidLeft][OpenMidLeft]D-don't be stupid.
That's not it at all![.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Hold on.[A]
You know, that man told me he found[.]
a frog in his boots the other day.[A]
And that man woke up to find
half his moustache shaved off.[A]
You wouldn't know anything about
that, would you?[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]N-no. This is the first I've heard of it.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Really?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Um, yeah[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Ooh! It WAS you, wasn't it?[.][A]
Ewan, you can't do things like that.
Even if it is kind of funny.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]But they're morons! All they do is get
you to dance, and then they run around[A]
on the battlefield challenging each other[.]
to [OpenQuote]contests of strength and valor[CloseQuote]![A]
They're dumb braggarts, and I was just
taking 'em down a peg.[A]
But I'm not jealous![A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]All right, all right.[.][A]
I'll keep your secret this time, [.]
but you must stop![A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]They're the troublemakers, you know?
Oh[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]OK. I got it.[.][A]
I'll leave 'em alone.[.]
But, Tethys?[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]What is it?[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]I'll always be here to protect you.[.]
I'm not too young for that![.][A]
So instead of always helping those guys,
dance for me once in a while.[.][A]
[ToggleSmile]I know it'll make me stronger![A][ToggleSmile][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]Ewan[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]I'll see you later![.]
You gotta promise to dance for me![A]
[0D24]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x11C][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x121][OpenMidRight]It's not such a good idea for you[.]
to dance too close to the front lines.[A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Hee hee!
Thanks for worrying about me, Ewan.[.][A]
But are you sure it's not just the
jealousy talking?[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]Th-that's not it at all!
It's dangerous! That's it![A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I'm sorry, I'm sorry.[.]
But you know, Ewan[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
Since you joined up with the army,
you really have gotten stronger.[A][ToggleSmile][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]I have, haven't I?
So I'm no longer a novice, right?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]No, you've truly grown.[.]
I'm glad, but also a little sad.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]Hmm. So when I'm a full-fledged[.]
mage, you're gonna be sad?[A][OpenMidLeft]I guess so. A little sad, anyways.[A]
I'm so much older than you that I've
always thought of you as a child.[.][A]
That's why I always thought I had[.]
to protect you.[.][A][OpenMidRight]You know, at the beginning of all of this 
I really was treating it like a game.[.][A]
Then I saw the dangers you faced to[.]
help everyone.[A]
I knew I couldn't treat it like a game
any longer.[.][A]
[CloseSpeechSlow][OpenMidRight][MoveRight][OpenRight]Battles threaten people's lives and need
to end quickly.[.][A]
That's why I need to boost my powers.[.]
I want to help you and the others.[A]
I have to become a full-fledged mage
to really do my part.[.][A]
So, don't be sad.[.]
I just want to protect you[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]Ewan[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][CloseSpeechSlow][OpenMidLeft][MoveLeft][.....][OpenRight]You've been looking after your little[.]
brother for so many years.[A]
Now it's my turn to return the favor.[.]
[ToggleSmile]I mean, I am the man of the family.[.][A]
So from now on, I'm gonna be helping [.]
you out.[A][ToggleSmile][ToggleSmile][OpenLeft]Thank you, Ewan. Hearing you say
that makes me very happy.[.][A]
It proves to me how much you've[.]
truly grown.[A]
[ToggleSmile]But that doesn't mean you need to[.]
rush off on your own or anything.[.][A]
[ToggleSmile]If I thought you didn't need me[.]
anymore, I would feel really sad.[.][A][OpenRight]There's no reason to get all weepy.[.][A]
No matter how old I get, you'll always
be my big sister. My one and only.[A]
[0D25]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x11E][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x11C][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Say, Marisa, you're left-handed, right?[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]How did you know that?[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Well, when you're carrying a sword, don't[.]
you always have it in your left hand?[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]No, I can use either hand[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
But my left hand is stronger.[.][A][OpenMidRight]So that's like a warning sign:
left hand equals danger.[A][OpenMidLeft]Warning sign[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]So why is it you always sleep on your[.]
right side?[.][A]
You know you never roll over
in your sleep?[A]
And even the slightest noise causes you[.]
to spring up. Do you ever really sleep?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]I have to do that.
Otherwise I wouldn't survive.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Wouldn't survive?[.]
[ToggleSmile]You must be exaggerating.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]I sleep with my dominant arm up.[A]
That way, if I'm attacked, my good arm
is ready to go.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Huh[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
Do all sword fighters sleep that way?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]If your dominant arm is cut, you're[.]
at a disadvantage in battle.[A]
That means death.[.][A][OpenMidRight]But doesn't your arm ever fall asleep?
Aren't there times when you can't use it?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]No. My father trained me when I was[.]
a child, so that doesn't happen.[A][OpenMidRight]When you were a child? How?[.]
Kids always roll around in their sleep.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]My father placed blunt swords at my sides[.]
when I slept to keep me from moving.[A][OpenMidRight]Your father did that?[.]
But that's so dangerous[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]No, the blades were rounded and dull. And it
worked. I don't roll over when sleeping.[A][OpenMidRight]Wow, sword fighters have some intense[.]
training methods, don't they?[.][A]
[ToggleSmile]I'm glad I was an average kid. I mean, I
was poor, but at least I slept freely.[A][ToggleSmile]
[0D26]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x11C][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x11E][OpenMidRight]Tethys.[.]
Are you right-handed?[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Will wonders never cease?[.]
You actually started a conversation.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]When you dance, you often[.]
begin by putting your right foot forward.[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Now I'm really amazed.
I can't believe you noticed.[A]
But footwork in dancing has nothing to do[.]
with being right- or left-handed.[.][A]
Dancing is a way of expressing feelings[.]
through body movement.[A]
All of one's experiences are incorporated[.]
and displayed in the way one dances.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]Experiences?
What kind of experiences?[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]That, my dear, is my little secret.[.]
Mine may be a bit unique, though.[.][A]
My life's taken some odd turns, but it's
because of them that I started dancing.[.][A]
And when I'm dancing, I'm happy.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]Hmmm.[.]
Your dances give people courage.[A]
Dancing suits you.[A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Doesn't it, though?[.]
All the mercenaries tell me that, too.[A]
Now that you understand my dancing, you're
truly a member of Gerik's team.[.][A][ToggleSmile]
[0D27]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x11E][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x11C][OpenMidRight]Tell me, Marisa, have you ever thought
about wanting to be reborn?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Reborn?[.][A][OpenMidRight]You know, coming back as someone else[.]
after you die?[A]
If you were going to be reborn,[.]
what would you like to be?[A]
[ToggleSmile]Perhaps a beautiful dancer like me?[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]I'm fine with being me.[.]
I can't imagine anything else.[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I thought that's what you'd say.[A]
Actually, I thought of lots of things, but
really can't imagine any other life.[A]
I guess that means that in spite of all the[.]
hardships we've faced, we're really happy.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]I suppose so[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]Living in this age means that we face many [.]
bad things and then worse things. Yet[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[ToggleSmile]We're alive, so that means we also get
good things and then better things, too.[A]
In tough times, I sometimes think I'd like
to be reborn in another time, but the[.][A]
important thing is to not give up and to
live your life to the fullest.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]When you die, life is over.[.]
There's no such thing as being reborn.[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Well, you may be right.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]We only get one chance.[.]
So all I can do is keep fighting.[.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]After all's said and done, you truly
like who and what you are, right?[.][A]
We have completely different lives, but[.]
we have that in common.[.][A]
That and the same man, right?[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]What?![....]
What do you mean?!?[.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]You can't hide it from me.[A]
I guess I should ask,[.]
do you think you're hiding it?[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft][MoveMidLeft][OpenMidLeft]I-I'm hiding nothing.[.]
Nothing at all![.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]What an interesting reaction.[.]
Youth is so cute.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft][MoveMidLeft][OpenMidLeft]Wh-why are you smiling?!
Ah[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Don't be embarrassed.[.][A]
We're going to be around each other for a[.]
long time. We should talk.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft][MoveMidLeft][OpenMidLeft]I've got to go![.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]There's no need to run away.
We may be rivals, but we're still friends.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft][MoveMidLeft][OpenMidLeft]I'm not running away![.]
I'm just[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]leaving![A]
[0D28]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x11C][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x124][OpenMidRight]Are you Tethys, the dancer
who captivates all audiences?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Who are you?[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Oh, you don't know me?
That's so disappointing.[A]
I am Rennac of Carcino.[.]
I beg your indulgence[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][ToggleSmile][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]It's a pleasure to meet you, Rennac.[A]
However, I'm a bit busy at the moment.
Perhaps we could talk another time.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Is that so? Very well then.[.]
Another day.[A][OpenMidLeft]Yes.[A][OpenMidRight]And perhaps I could have you
dance for me and me alone.[A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Hm?[.][A]
I will of course dance if you ask, but[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
For you and you alone?[A]
[ToggleSmile]Are you perhaps attempting to woo me?[.]
If that's the case, you should stop. I've[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]No, no, that's not what I[.]
was intending at all.[.][A]
Yet many women who say they're not
interested end up in my arms all the same.[A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Well, if that's the case,[.]
[ToggleSmile]maybe I'll keep my eye on you.[A]
If you turn out to be such a catch,[.]
I may rethink my stance.[A][OpenMidRight]It's a deal then.[.][A]
I ask that you observe my[.]
conduct closely.[A]
Good day.[.][A][OpenMidRight][ClearFace][......][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Oh, dear[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
I think he took me seriously.[.][A]
I hope he doesn't get his[.]
hopes up too high.[A][ToggleSmile]
[0D29]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x11C][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x124][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Ah, the beauteous Tethys.[.]
It's a pleasure to see you again.[.][A]
Well? Have I made an impression on [.]
you yet?[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Well[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[ToggleSmile]You seem to be[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]unobjectionable.[A]
Yet you've a long way to go, I think.[.][A][ToggleSmile][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]That's a bit severe, isn't it?
Is there something specific you desire?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Oh, well[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]perhaps you could[.]
bring me something?[.][A][OpenMidRight]Bring you something?
A gift, is that it?[.][A]
Very well. What shall it be?[A][OpenMidLeft]Um[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[0D2A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x11C][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x124][OpenMidLeft]Oh.[.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Tethys.[.]
I've been looking for you.[A]
[ToggleSmile]You haven't been avoiding me, have you?[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Oh, of course not.
Hee hee[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][ToggleSmile][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]The object you spoke of the other day?
I have it here. Please take a look.[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Um.[.]
[ToggleSmile]Oh, yes. That. Of course.[.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]You forgot what you[.]
asked for, didn't you?[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]That's, that's[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][ToggleSmile]not true.[.][A][OpenMidRight]OK, then take a look.[.]
Here it is.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Ooh[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]What do you think?[A][OpenMidLeft]It's nice.
Very pretty.[A][OpenMidRight]It's as big as a fist.[A]
Notice how the red, white, and blue colors
play across the surface of the gems.[A][OpenMidLeft]It really exists.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Did you say something?[A][OpenMidLeft]No, nothing. Pay me no mind.[A][OpenMidRight]Well, I brought it to you[.]
as promised.[A]
So this proves that[.]
I'm worthy, does it not?[A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yes.[A]
I now realize that despite your appearance,[.]
you're a very hard worker.[A]
[ToggleSmile]Does that make you a good catch?
Hmm[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]I'm still not convinced.[A][OpenMidRight]Really?[.]
How disappointing.[A]
Is there something else you desire?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Let me see[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
There is this[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[0D2B]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x126][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x120][OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
Um[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]May I help you?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Saleh, wherever we go, you're[.]
always at my side.[A]
Don't you ever do anything
YOU want to do?[.][A][OpenMidRight]I came from Caer Pelyn.[.][A]
I have been entrusted with the
honor of being your escort.[.][A]
Protecting you, Great Dragon,[.]
gives my life meaning.[A][OpenMidLeft]Great Dragon? Please, there's[.]
no need to call me that.[A]
My father is the great one.[.][A]
I've done nothing. I'm not
great at all.[.][A][OpenMidRight]It is true, Great Dragon, that your[.]
exalted father once saved mankind.[A]
On that day so long ago, he shielded
us from evil. He is our true savior.[A]
However, mankind has forgotten that[.]
most sacred debt we owe him.[A]
I do, as we all must, what I can to[.]
atone for that crime of neglect.[A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]Great Dragon, does my presence
bother you?[.][A]
If it does, please do not hesitate
to tell me.[.][A]
I would remove myself at once and[.]
not bother you again until needed.[A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
It's fine. Do whatever
pleases you.[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]Thank you.[A]
[0D2C]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x126][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x120][OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]Um[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]Yes?[A][OpenMidLeft]There's something I wanted to ask.[A]
You're from Caer Pelyn.[.][A]
Do you know if my father has ever[.]
visited your village?[.][A][OpenMidRight]He has. I myself have never seen
his noble personage.[A]
However, I have heard that Dara[.]
met him once when she was young.[A]
Some monsters had wandered into Caer
Pelyn, and the Great Dragon saved us.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Really?[.][A]
I wonder why my father
chose to help you.[A][OpenMidRight]That, I cannot guess.[.][A]
We poor humans cannot hope to grasp[.]
the thinking of the Great Dragon.[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
My father has dedicated his life
to protecting humans.[.][A]
For the longest time, I could not[.]
fathom why he would do this.[A]
But now, after spending time
with all of you[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][Clear]
[ToggleSmile]I begin to understand how he felt.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]Great Dragon[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I'm sure that I[.][ToggleMouthMove]--[ToggleMouthMove][A]
that I will continue to fight,
as he did, for all humanity.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]I am truly grateful that you
feel that way, Great Dragon.[A]
[0D2D]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x120][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x126][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]Great Dragon[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
I know I'm being rude, but
I've a favor to ask.[A][OpenMidRight]What is it?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Would you please come[.]
to our village?[.][A][OpenMidRight]To Caer Pelyn?[A]
But[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]Dara and the other villagers
would be overjoyed to see you.[A]
The village is quite spare, but we
would do our best to entertain you.[.][A]
You could stay for as long as you[.]
wanted[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
Saleh, you made that request
on my behalf, didn't you?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]No, not at all.[.][A]
I apologize. I have[.]
been disrespectful.[.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]No, I'm pleased.[A]
[ToggleSmile]However[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
I doubt I should
stay too long.[A][OpenMidLeft]Why is that?[A][OpenMidRight]It's because I'm a dragon.[A]
My father explained it to me.[.][A]
We are both human and monster.[A]
And because we are both, we[.]
are also neither.[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]We have the power of dragons; therefore,
we cannot live together with humans[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
We have the hearts of humans; therefore,
we do not belong with monsters.[.][A]
We are outcasts in this world, never
a part of either community.[.][A]
And so we live our lives alone, never[.]
to be understood by anyone.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]But there are humans whose actions make[.]
them monsters in the eyes of others.[A]
I do not think of you as such when there are
many worse monsters among my own kind.[A]
Regardless, I believe the villagers would[.]
be most pleased to have you visit.[A][OpenMidRight]Saleh[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[ToggleSmile]Thank you. Your words have cheered
me up a little.[.][A]
Please wait for my answer. When all[.]
of this is finished[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
When peace returns, I'll give you[.]
my answer then.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]I understand.[.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]And when I do return to Darkling
Woods, I will not be sad.[.][A]
Because of the time I've spent with[.]
you, the memories you've given me,[A]
I shall not be lonely. I shall
never feel like an outcast again.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Lady Myrrh[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[0D2E]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x120][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x121][OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Teacher![A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
Oh, Ewan![.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]You were practicing Valega, weren't you?[A]
[ToggleSmile][OpenQuote]To know the harmony of heaven and earth,[.]
body and spirit[CloseQuote][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][ToggleSmile]right?[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Yes, you are correct.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Um[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][OpenQuote]To contemplate oneself[CloseQuote][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
And[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]what was the rest?[A][OpenMidLeft][OpenQuote]To contemplate the world and to envision[.]
all creation. Thus, to be enlightened.[CloseQuote][.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Oh, that's right.[.][A]
Doesn't it get to be a bother finding[.]
a quiet place like this, though?[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Contemplation takes time, Ewan. It doesn't
matter where, so long as you do it.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Oh[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[ToggleSmile]Well, if Valega is an important part of[.]
Caer Pelyn's culture and history,[.][A]
I think I might give it a try.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Really? And I wonder how many[.]
days you'll last at that.[.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Heh. I guess you're right. Knowing the
harmony of the heavens sounds tough.[A]
Do you have anything easier I could[.]
practice in the meantime?[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Hm. Let me think. Your skill level
is still quite low, but[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Thanks, Teacher.[A]
I remember when you first decided[.]
to teach me some magic.[.][A]
I was so excited that I went out
and practiced over and over again.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]You must pace yourself. Using too much
magic can drain both body and soul.[.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yeah. Boy, I know that.[.][A]
After that time, I was so tired[.]
that I couldn't stay awake.[.][A]
I was so tired that I slept for[.]
a full day. I woke up in bed[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Technically, it was two days.[.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Oh, so that was you who[.]
carried me home?[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Mm-hm.[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Now that I think about it, no one[.]
else would have bothered! Thank you.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Ewan, don't push yourself too[.]
hard. Magic is no game.[.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I know, and don't worry![A][ToggleSmile]
[0D2F]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x120][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x121][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Teacher.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]What is it, Ewan?[.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Do you remember a few years ago when
you went to visit Commander Gerik?[A]
That was when I met you and followed
you back to Caer Pelyn.[.][A]
I never said thank you for taking me
in, Teacher. I've never regretted it.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]I remember it clearly. I kept thinking,[.]
[OpenQuote]What have I gotten myself into?[CloseQuote][.][A][OpenMidRight]If that's the way you felt about it,
why did you let me be your student?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Your eyes.[A][OpenMidRight]My eyes?[A][OpenMidLeft]You had a spark in your eyes.[.][A]
I knew that I saw an exceptional
talent for magic in those eyes.[.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Wow. That's really something.[.]
I would never have guessed.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]I'm sure, as your training progresses,
that you will feel your power grow.[.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I'll train even harder, then![.][A]
Back when I first started, I[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
thought you were kinda scary.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Me?[.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Well, you don't really talk much.[.][A]
I always thought you were angry[.]
with me, and I didn't know why.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]All that because I was so silent
all the time?[.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yep. But after a while, I figured[.]
out it was just the way you were.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Ewan, you can never find truth in[.]
words, spoken or unspoken.[A]
Truth lives within the heart.[.][A][OpenMidRight]But other people can't see what's[.]
inside your heart, can they?[A][OpenMidLeft]If you can trust one another, you[.]
can see. And you will understand.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Oh! Is that how it works?[.]
[ToggleSmile]I think I get it now.[.][A]
But talking is so important in
building friendships, isn't it?[.][A]
We use words to communicate things
like feelings and ideas.[A]
But all that stuff, it's just on
the surface. Does that mean that[A]
if people use their hearts, they
can communicate without using words?[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]That's right.[.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]You really are great, Teacher.[A]
You teach me by making me teach myself,[.]
and I mean more than just magic[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]Remember how angry you were at
me that one time?[.][A]
Back when I took out that magic tome?[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
I wasn't angry that you[.]
took the tome out with you.[.][A]
It's that you took it with you
without asking and went for a stroll.[.][A]
And then you stopped to[.]
play in the river[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]That's right. Then I dropped it and[.]
SPLASH!! Right in it went[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
It wasn't in the water long, but those
pages were totally illegible[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]That utter carelessness[.][ToggleMouthMove]--[ToggleMouthMove]
No, your lack of consideration.[.][A]
That's what made me angry.[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I'm s-sorry.[A]
[ToggleSmile]But I never took any books with[.]
me when I went to the river after that.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]And there were other things, as well.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Oh, you don't mean[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]that?[.]
Oh, yeah. [ToggleSmile]Ha ha ha.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Unbelievable[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
I've never had a student
so troublesome as you.[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]But I promise to be much more[.]
careful in the future![A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Is there even a shred of
truth in those words?[.][A][OpenMidRight][MoveMidRight][OpenMidRight]Y-yikes![A][OpenMidLeft]You rascal[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[0D30]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x120][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x121][OpenMidLeft]Ewan.[.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Oh, Teacher.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Ewan[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]If something happens to me, take
all my scrolls and magical items, and[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
keep them for your own.[.][A][OpenMidRight]What? Why would you say that?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]This conflict has grown bitter. I'm[.]
not sure I'll see it to its end.[A]
And[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]if something does happen,[.]
I want you to care for Dara.[A]
Watch over her and Caer Pelyn.[A][OpenMidRight][MoveRight][OpenRight]Oh, come on! There is no way anything[.]
is going to happen to you, Teacher![.][A]
And besides, if you weren't around,[.]
I would have no clue what to do.[A][OpenMidLeft]Ewan[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]Don't underestimate yourself.[.]
One day, you will surpass me.[.][A][OpenRight]Huh? Really? Do you mean that, Teacher?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]It all hinges on your own efforts.[A][OpenRight][MoveRight][OpenRight][ToggleSmile]I won't let you down![.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Only those who choose magic can handle it.
And you are special even among them[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
Be confident. You have a rare gift that[.]
others can never duplicate.[.][A][OpenRight]Teacher[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[ToggleSmile]If you really mean that, then there's[.]
no way I'm going to let you die.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Ewan[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenRight][ToggleSmile]I'll be at your side protecting you.[A]
If the two of us combine our power, we can
get through anything that arises![.][A][ToggleSmile][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Whew[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
Protect[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]me?[.][A]
I had no idea until this moment[.]
how dependable you've become.[.][A][OpenRight]Right! That's because I'm the great[.]
sage Saleh's number-one student![A][OpenMidLeft]Well spoken, Ewan.
Come on, follow me.[.][A]
I'll use this war to teach you every
last bit of the magic I know.[.][A]
My dear, sweet student.[.][A][OpenRight]Sounds good, Teach![.][A]
[0D31]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x121][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x123][OpenMidRight]Hello, laddie.[A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Oh, hi![.][.....]
[ToggleSmile]Uh[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Gwah ha ha! The name's Dozla.[.][A][ToggleSmile][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]I'm Ewan. It's nice to meet[.]
you, Dozla, sir![A][OpenMidRight]Aren't you a little bundle of energy?[.]
I bet you're a regular troublemaker.[A]
So, what were you so lost in thought
over? You having any problems?[A][OpenMidLeft]Nope, nothing.
I don't have any problems.[A]
I was thinking of something interesting.
You want to hear about it?[A][OpenMidRight]Sure. Tell me everything.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Well, I was thinking of how much fun it[.]
would be if I could do something[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Uh-huh.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Some battlegrounds are full of plants and[.]
stuff, but others are dreary and dead.[A][OpenMidRight]Yeah.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]If a place like that were suddenly filled[.]
with beautiful colors, it'd be neat, right?[.][A]
Like if it could suddenly become
a flower garden?[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Ho ho, a battleground becoming a
lovely flower garden?[.][A]
[ToggleSmile]Aye, that would be nice. It would help
heal the hearts and minds of the soldiers.[A]
But how would you do it? Do you have some[.]
sort of magical powers or something?[A][OpenMidLeft]Yeah, I do, but I've decided that[.]
wouldn't be the best way.[.][A]
If I did that, people would be more impressed[.]
by the magic than by the flowers.[.][A]
I think it would be better to make it[.]
something that anyone could do and enjoy.[.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Oh[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
It's all too difficult for me to follow,
[ToggleSmile]but it sure sounds like a nice dream.[.][A]
If you could pull it off, I'm sure
people would really enjoy it.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Ha ha[.][ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]I haven't really thought
much about how I would do it.[.][A]
I was just thinking how nice it[.]
would be, that's all.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Gwah ha ha! That's fine. That's what
young people are supposed to do.[A]
Many great things come from the[.]
daydreams of youth.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Really? Do you think so? All
right! I like you, mister.[A][OpenMidRight]Gwah ha ha! Is that so?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Yep. And I'm going to call you
Uncle Dozla from now on![A]
It's about time for me to get going.
I'll talk to you later, Uncle Dozla![A][OpenMidRight]All right, laddie!
Till next time![.][A]
[0D32]
[ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x121][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x123][OpenMidRight]Ho, laddie.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Uncle Dozla![A][OpenMidRight]So, you're in high spirits today?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Yep! I'm always in high spirits.
How about you, Uncle?[.][A][OpenMidRight]Oh, I'm doing as well as can be[.]
expected. I'm a bit tired, actually.[A]
I'm a bit closer to the ground than everyone
else, so my legs tire easily. Gwah ha![A]
It would be nice if there were an easier
way to move around, wouldn't it?[A][OpenMidLeft]Oh, that reminds me.
I've been thinking of something.[A]
Do you want to hear about it?[.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]What's this? Have you come up with
yet another fabulous idea?[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Yep![A][OpenMidRight]Well, what is it?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Coaches! You're familiar
with coaches, right?[A][OpenMidRight]Uh-huh.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]And we've got a coach in our convoy[.]
because it can carry people and supplies.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Yeah, they're useful enough.[A]
They're nice if you're traveling far with 
wounded men, children, and whatnot.[.][A]
[ToggleSmile]But without roads, they're almost useless,
and forget about dense forests.[.][A]
Oh, and they can be quite vulnerable in[.]
a battle. Not very useful at all, really.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Exactly! So I was thinking about coaches
that could travel in the air[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]What's that?[A][Clear]
Are you talking about using[.]
pegasus knights?[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]That's what I was thinking at first. But
you know, that probably wouldn't work.[A]
I mean, a pegasus can get mighty picky
about who it lets ride him, right?[A]
I haven't really thought about how to[.]
actually make a flying coach, but[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
But wouldn't it be amazing if one[.]
really existed?[.][A]
It would be fast, and all that stuff like[.]
bad roads and forests wouldn't matter![A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Ho ho ho ho![A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]And even if people lived far apart, they
could visit one another quickly![A]
What do you think?[A][OpenMidRight][MoveMidRight][OpenMidRight]Gwah ha ha! It's fantastic! And it
would be useful, that's for sure![.][A]
Sounds like fun, too. I'd sure love[.]
to ride about in a flying coach.[A]
Think about it[ToggleMouthMove]--[ToggleMouthMove]the land spread out below,
glittering dawn skies[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]and the wind![.][A]
Ah, it all sounds like a dream.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]I hope it becomes reality someday.[A][OpenMidRight]Me, too.[A]
I like the way your mind works,[.]
laddie. Let's talk more later.[A][OpenMidLeft]Yep![A]
[0D33]
[ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x121][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x123][OpenMidLeft]Ah, Uncle Dozla.[A]
Listen to this, will you? I've
been thinking about something new.[A][OpenMidRight]Ooh, I can hardly wait.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Imagine people far away from each[.]
other talking.[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Far away? You mean, like, if you
and I were maybe[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]100 paces apart?[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Nope. Farther than that.[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]All right, 1,000 paces![.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Not even close. Farther still![A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]10,000 paces? You must be kidding.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]No, I'm not. And even farther than
that! For example[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
What if one person were in Frelia,
and the other person were in Rausten?[.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]What?![A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]That's right! Anyone you could
think of, you could talk to.[A]
I read about magical devices that[.]
could do the same thing, but[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
Wouldn't it be better if anyone[.]
could do it, and not just mages?[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Impressive! I think I see it[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
People could send and receive important[.]
messages instantly, is that it?[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]No, even better than that![A]
I'm not talking about just sending
messages back and forth.[A]
I mean like if they could talk,[.]
just like you and I are now![A]
We wouldn't need messengers at
all! It would all happen instantly![.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I just can't wrap my head around this[.]
one, laddie. It's too much for me.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Great, isn't it?[A]
You could contact your people in
Rausten from anywhere, at any time![.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]My, oh my[.][ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]You've got quite
an imagination, don't you?[A]
The things you come up with always
surprise me, laddie.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Ha ha ha.[.][A]
I used to get in trouble for always[.]
thinking up these outlandish things.[A][OpenMidRight]Gwah ha ha! That's a shame, laddie.[.][A]
After all, I'm sure a lot of the things[.]
we have now seemed outlandish once.[.][A]
If nobody dreamed, nothing new would
ever be created, would it?[A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Uncle Dozla[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[ToggleSmile]You always have time to listen to my
ideas, Uncle. It makes me really happy.[.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]It's always worth the time to listen to[.]
you youngsters and your ideas.[A]
It's sad, but I know people who are so
busy that they've no time to spare.[.][A]
[ToggleSmile]But me, I've got time. As you know,[.]
I'm one of Princess L'Arachel's men.[A]
I'm not the brightest fellow around, so[.]
she doesn't give me a lot to do.[A]
But that gives me lots of free time, and
I'm always happy to spend it with you.[A][OpenMidLeft]Thank you. I think you're[.]
the best, Uncle Dozla![A][OpenMidRight][MoveMidRight][OpenMidRight]Gwah ha ha! What a nice thing to say.[.]
And I think you're the best, laddie.[A]
I think when you're fully grown, you're[.]
going to be a great and interesting man.[A][OpenMidLeft]Do you really think so?[.][A][OpenMidRight]I do. It's that sparkle in
your eyes that convinces me.[A][OpenMidLeft][MoveMidLeft][OpenMidLeft]Yahoo! Ha ha ha.[A][OpenMidRight]I'm looking forward to the day when I see[.]
one of your ideas made reality.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]And that day will surely come.[A]
It's weird[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]but there are times when
I can almost picture a world like that.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Gwah ha ha![.]
Now that would be something.[A]
I'll have to make sure I live[.]
long enough to see it.[A][OpenMidLeft]Yep! And you'll have to[.]
stay my friend, too![A][OpenMidRight]Well, of course![A]
[0D34]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x119][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x121][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Hey![......]
What's your name?[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Me?[.]
I'm Amelia.[.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Ah. Amelia[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
My name's Ewan. Hi![.][A][ToggleSmile][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Hi, Ewan. It's nice[.]
to meet you.[A]
So, are you fighting
with us?[A][OpenMidRight]Yep, I am.
I'm a mage.[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Really?[.][A]
[ToggleSmile]You look like you're only[.]
about my age. That's neat.[A][OpenMidRight]Ha ha! Ah, I'm nothing special
compared to my teacher.[.][A]
You want to see some magic?[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]H-here? Now? But[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
isn't that dangerous?[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]Oh, don't worry. Magic isn't
just for combat. For example[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
Voila! It can do stuff like this![.][A][OpenMidLeft]Wow[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
They're so pretty![A]
All those little lights,
spinning around together[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
Is this really magic?[.][A][OpenMidRight]This?[.][....]
This is magic used to make girls happy.[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Hm?[.][.....] Ah!
[ToggleSmile]Oh, Ewan, stop teasing.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Ha ha ha.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Ha ha.[A][OpenMidRight]You should show me how good you[.]
are with your lance sometime.[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Huh? Um, all right. But[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
I'm sure you'd be bored.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]That's not true.[A]
And even if it were, it's simply
a matter of how you make it fun.[A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]How you[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]make it fun?[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]Uh-huh.[.]
Like this war, for example.[.][A]
Well, Amelia, I'll
see you later![A][OpenMidRight][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Hey![A]
[ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][.....]
Ewan sure moves at his own pace[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][Clear]
How you make it fun? Hmm[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[ToggleSmile]That seems like a good rule to
live by, when you think about it.[.][A]
[0D35]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x119][OpenMidLeft]Ah[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][CloseSpeechSlow][OpenMidLeft][MoveFarRight][ToggleSmile][OpenFarRight]Whew. This looks like a[.]
good place to take a break.[.][A][......][OpenFarFarLeft][LoadFace][0x121][OpenFarFarLeft][MoveMidLeft][OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]...![ToggleMouthMove][.....]
[ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A][CloseSpeechSlow][OpenMidLeft][MoveRight][......][OpenRight]Boo![A][OpenFarRight][MoveFarRight][OpenFarRight][ToggleSmile]AHHHH![A][ToggleSmile][OpenFarRight][ClearFace][OpenRight][ClearFace][.......][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x121][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x119][OpenMidLeft]Ha ha ha![.]
Amelia, it's me.[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Ah![.][....]
Ewan?[.][A]
Why did you do that? I thought
you were one of the enemy![A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Ha ha ha. We talked about this,[.]
remember? How you make it fun?[A]
I just wanted to make our meeting[.]
here a little more fun.[.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Well, it wasn't fun[.]
for me at all.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Ha ha ha.[.][A]
Oh, yeah, Amelia?[.][A]
Do you remember you promised to[.]
show me your lance work?[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Um[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]yeah.[.]
I remember.[.][A]
[ToggleSmile]Well, all right. Here.
Watch closely.[A][OpenMidLeft]Oh, I will.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight][MoveRight][OpenRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenRight][MoveRight][OpenRight]HA![.]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]YAH![A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]That's good.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenRight][MoveFarRight][OpenFarRight]AH![.][A]
[OpenFarRight][MoveFarRight][OpenFarRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]WAH![A][OpenMidLeft]Neat.[.][A][OpenFarRight][MoveMidRight][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidRight][MoveMidRight][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]YAAAH!![.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]That was great![.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]Thanks.[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]You're good, Amelia. You're as good[.]
as any of the other knights.[A][ToggleSmile][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]Do you mean that?[.]
[ToggleSmile]Whew[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[ToggleSmile]To be honest, I have been practicing
even harder lately.[.][A]
But it was all worth it to hear you[.]
say that. Thanks.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Really? No, thank you.
I like your outfit, too.[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Huh?[A]
Oh, I get it.[.][A][Clear]
You're teasing me again,
aren't you, Ewan?[.][A]
What was it, again?[.]
[OpenQuote]Making things fun[CloseQuote]?[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Ha ha ha. No, that's not
at all what I was doing.[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Hmm[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
I'm not sure I should believe you.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Ha ha ha.[.][A]
Princess Eirika has a similar[.]
outfit. Is that a popular style?[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Um[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]I don't know.[.][A]
[ToggleSmile]But it's easy to move in, so[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]I see. I think it's cute. Especially
that stain right there.[.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Oh[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
Ewan, you're such a twit![.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Ha ha ha.[.][A]
[0D36]
[ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x121][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x119][OpenMidLeft]Amelia, have you traveled much?[.][A][OpenMidRight]Travel?[.][A][Clear]
[ToggleSmile]Hm, let's see[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
I went from Silva to the
capital on my own once.[.][A]
Now that I think about it, I'd
never left Grado until now.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Oh, really?[.][A]
My teacher[ToggleMouthMove]--[ToggleMouthMove]he's the great
sage Saleh from Caer Pelyn[ToggleMouthMove]--[ToggleMouthMove][A]
took me out on a training[.]
journey for many months once.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Where did you go?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Lots of different places across Magvel.[.][A]
We went to Renais, Frelia, Rausten, and[.]
Jehanna. Oh, and we went to Grado, too.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Wow, that sounds great.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Yeah, it was a lot of fun! There
were so many new things to see.[.][A]
Say, Amelia, I just had an idea[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]What is it?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]When this war is over and we're all at peace,[.]
why don't you and I take a trip together?[.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Huh? Just the two of us?[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Sure, why not? Does[.]
the idea bother you?[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]No, it's just[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]There's so much I want
to show you, Amelia.[A]
How the dark green forests refract the
morning sun into a million burning emeralds.[A]
The melancholy spectacle of the sun sinking 
slowly beyond an endless horizon.[.][A]
The wind gently coercing vast fields of[.]
wheat to dance, heroic mountain peaks[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
Oh, and the gorgeous flower beds that[.]
fill your vision with brilliant colors![.][A]
There are so very many spectacular
places in the world.[A]
I want to see all of them again[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]but[.]
this time I want to see them with you.[A]
When you see them, you'll really understand[.]
how wonderful it is to be alive.[A]
The feeling will fill your heart and
make you want to sing with joy![.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]That's so[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]eloquent, Ewan.[.][A]
[ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[ToggleSmile]But I understand what you're
trying to say, and yes. Let's go![.][A]
I want to see all of it and more![.][A][OpenMidLeft][MoveMidLeft][OpenMidLeft]Great!
Then it's settled.[A]
You know what? This gives us something to[.]
look forward to while this war goes on.[.][A]
Just thinking about it makes my heart[.]
beat faster.[A][OpenMidRight]Ha ha.[A]
You know, Ewan, being around you fills
me with so much energy.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]And I'm happy when you're around, too.[A][OpenMidRight]I'm looking forward to our trip.[A]
It's one more reason for us to work[.]
quickly to put an end to this war.[A][OpenMidLeft]Yeah, let's do what we can, because[.]
we're definitely taking that trip![A]
[0D37]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x122][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x123][OpenMidLeft][MoveMidLeft][OpenMidLeft]Oh, I cannot believe it.[A]
There is something very[.]
wrong with this world.[A][OpenMidRight]Hm?! What is it? What's[.]
happened, Princess L'Arachel?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Hello, Dozla.[.]
Listen to this.[.][A]
The other day, I paid a visit[.]
to a nearby village.[A]
I found something inconceivable there.[A]
Not one of them had ever heard of the[.]
beautiful banisher of darkness before.[A][OpenMidRight]What?![A]
Even with your anonymous campaign[.]
to rid the world of monstrosities?[A]
I cannot fathom how those people
could be so uninformed![.][A][OpenMidLeft]Last night, I was so distraught that I
quite nearly drowned my pillow in tears.[A]
This will never do, Dozla.[A]
I must be more famous. The entire[.]
world must know of my legend.[.][A]
The troubadours must be made to[.]
sing my praises far and wide.[.][A][OpenMidRight]And I'm sure they will![.][A][OpenMidLeft]The five heroes who banished evil[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
My own sacred ancestor[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
Oh, to be like them[.][ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]I so long[.]
to be praised by the masses, too.[.][A][OpenMidRight][MoveMidRight][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Gwah ha ha![.]
And you shall be, Princess![.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]But I get the feeling that we're going
to have to change our methodology.[A]
Appealing to the common people is of
the utmost importance.[A]
First and foremost, we need a plan of[.]
action. A means to win their hearts.[A]
Please, Dozla, I want you to
think of something, too.[A][OpenMidRight][MoveMidRight][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Gwah ha ha![.]
Leave it to your trusted Dozla![.][A][ToggleSmile]
[0D38]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x122][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x123][OpenMidLeft]Dozla, have you thought[.]
of any good plans?[A][OpenMidRight][MoveMidRight][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Gwah ha ha! Prepare yourself
for joy, Princess L'Arachel![A]
I, Dozla, have come up with a[.]
plan of masterpiece proportions![A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Oh! That is good news![A]
Don't keep me waiting, Dozla.[.]
Let me hear it.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Gwah ha! Here goes![.][A]
[ToggleSmile]All of the heroes from the dawn of
time had two names, did they not?[.][A]
So what you need, Princess, is another
name. Something with oomph![.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Oh, Dozla! What a splendid idea![A]
An alias would make it easier for[.]
the people to remember me.[A]
Very well, Dozla, we must come up[.]
with a wonderful epithet for me.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]Hmm[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][Clear]
[....]Aha![A]
[ToggleSmile]It's come to me, Princess L'Arachel![A]
How do you like the sound of [OpenQuote]the[.]
green-haired battle princess[CloseQuote]?[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Um, no.[.][A]
I want something with more force.[.]
Something with more[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]impact.[.][A][Clear]
[.....][ToggleSmile]I've got it![A]
What do you think of [OpenQuote]the beautiful[.]
princess of peerless beauty[CloseQuote]?![A][ToggleSmile][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]Oh! It's fantastic![.][A]
You're amazing, Princess L'Arachel![.]
What a splendid nickname![.][A][OpenMidLeft]Of course it is.[A]
L'Arachel, [OpenQuote]the beautiful princess of[.]
peerless beauty[CloseQuote]![.][A]
It has such a nice ring to it. Just[.]
rolls off the tongue, doesn't it?[.][A][OpenMidRight][MoveMidRight][OpenMidRight]Gwah ha![A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]What we do now is vital[.]
to our success, Dozla.[A]
It wouldn't do for me to ride about[.]
calling myself by my own nickname.[A]
It must be spread about in a
nonchalant manner.[A]
Dozla, starting now, I want you to refer
to me exclusively by my epithet,[A]
[OpenQuote]L'Arachel, the beautiful princess of peerless
beauty,[CloseQuote] when you're among the soldiers.[A]
And don't forget to slip it into
everyday conversation, too.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight][MoveMidRight][OpenMidRight]Gwah ha ha![.]
Understood, Princess L'Arachel![.][A]
[0D39]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x122][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x123][OpenMidLeft]How is it progressing, Dozla?[.][A]
Is it working?[A][OpenMidRight][MoveMidRight][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Gwah ha ha![.]
You will be pleased, Princess L'Arachel![A]
Just recently I saw a group of
villagers together gossiping.[.][A]
They'd seen a suspicious young woman in[.]
fantastic garb riding around at night.[A]
And they called that enigmatic woman [OpenQuote]the[.]
beautiful princess of peerless beauty[CloseQuote]![.][A][ToggleSmile][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Yes! They were most certainly[.]
talking about me then.[A]
At last, I am becoming known amongst
the people of the land.[.][A]
Those three long trips I took around
the area were worth the trouble.[A][OpenMidRight][MoveMidRight][OpenMidRight]Gwah ha ha![.]
You're so right, Princess L'Arachel![A]
There can be no doubt that the
villagers were appropriately impressed.[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yet I find it passing strange.[A]
How is it that no one has[.]
appeared to imitate me?[.][A]
The beautiful banisher of darkness
was well enough known, after all.[.][A]
It's only natural that someone somewhere
would have aspired to be like me.[.][A]
The fact that no imitators have appeared
has me very worried, I must say.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight][MoveMidRight][OpenMidRight]Gwah ha ha![.]
How right you are![A]
But you are peerless, Princess L'Arachel,[.]
as your nickname says![A]
It would be impossible for anyone to
claim your beauty as her own![.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Well, that is true. It certainly was
not easy for me, after all.[.][A][Clear]
[ToggleSmile]Yet now, I am destined to be
remembered in the future as a hero.[.][A]
I wonder how my legend will be passed on
after I leave this earth.[.][A]
I am so looking forward to it.[A]
[OpenQuote]The beautiful princess of peerless[.]
beauty,[CloseQuote] L'Arachel[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
Ah[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]How enchanting.[.][A]
Already, I weep for the world that
will one day be robbed of my beauty.[A][OpenMidRight]Gwah ha ha![.][A][OpenMidLeft]I must do something spectacular this
battle to ensure my name is remembered.[.][A]
Let's go, Dozla.[A][OpenMidRight][MoveMidRight][OpenMidRight]Gwah ha ha! Ready as ever,
Princess L'Arachel![.][A]
[0D3A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x122][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x124][OpenMidLeft]Just a moment, Rennac.[A][OpenMidRight][MoveMidRight][OpenMidRight]Yipes![A][OpenMidLeft][MoveMidLeft][OpenMidLeft]And what do you[.]
mean, [OpenQuote]yipes[CloseQuote]?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][MoveMidLeft][OpenMidLeft]Is meeting me honestly such[.]
an unpleasant affair?[.][A][OpenMidRight]It's just that my job becomes difficult[.]
when noisy people like you are about.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Noisy? How rude! Couldn't you have
said showy? Or flamboyant, perhaps!?[A][OpenMidRight]But that would be lying.
You really are noisy.[.][A]
Do you even realize that
you were yelling just now?[A][OpenMidLeft]Yell? Me!? Why, I never!
You've gone too far![A]
Rennac, you would do well to remember that
your number-one priority is guarding me.[A][OpenMidRight]That's not the case anymore.[A]
These people respect my abilities[.]
and value my skills.[A][OpenMidLeft]Very well, I grant that you've made[.]
yourself useful out here.[.][A]
However, sir, you know nothing about
how to treat a lady![A]
You would do well to refine yourself.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Now, who's being rude? I happen[.]
to be quite the gentleman.[A]
For instance, I have some small[.]
renown as a fabulous dancer.[A][OpenMidLeft]You? A dancer? I wonder if you're[.]
not merely flattering yourself[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight][MoveMidRight][OpenMidRight]You don't think I can dance? Then test
me! You'll see how well I can dance![A]
Come on, get down off your horse.[.][A][OpenMidLeft][MoveMidLeft][OpenMidLeft]Me? Dance with you?[.][A]
Do you believe I would
dance with a commoner?[A]
Please, our stations would
never permit it.[A][OpenMidRight][MoveMidRight][OpenMidRight]It's not a matter of station. If you
permit us to dance, you would see.[A]
Unless[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]Wait a minute, maybe
YOU'RE the one who can't dance![.][A][OpenMidLeft][MoveMidLeft][OpenMidLeft]Rennac! You overstep yourself![A]
[OpenMidLeft][MoveMidLeft][OpenMidLeft]All right! If you dare speak such[.]
blasphemies, then I have no choice![.][A]
When next we meet, I will test your[.]
vainglorious boast myself![A][Clear]
But remember, my dancing with one[.]
such as you is a rare occasion.[.][A]
Because it will be so special, I
expect you to be most grateful.[.][A]
Got it!?[A][OpenMidRight]Yeah, yeah.[.]
I get it.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Very well. I suggest you devote yourself
to practicing while you've the time.[A][OpenMidRight]Now, you're the one who's gone too far![.]
I'm going to make you eat your words.[.][A]
[0D3B]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x124][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x122][SendToBack][OpenMidLeft]So[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]Rennac. We finally meet again.[A]
Do you remember our agreement?[A][OpenMidRight]Princess L'Arachel! Well,[.]
of course I remember, but[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
Surely, this isn't the place for
a, er, dance off, is it?[A][OpenMidLeft]Stop your complaining![A]
You will make yourself available
at MY leisure, sir.[.][A]
Now then, shall we dance?[.][A][OpenMidRight]Are you serious?![.][A]
In THIS place? It's preposterous![.]
It's ridiculous[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft][MoveRight][OpenMidRight][MoveFarRight][OpenRight]Very well, let us begin.[A][OpenFarRight]Yes, yes, I know what happens[.]
next. Oh, bother[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenRight]1[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]2[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]3[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][CloseSpeechSlow][OpenRight][MoveRight][OpenRight][MoveMidRight][OpenMidRight][MoveMidRight][OpenMidRight][MoveRight][OpenFarRight][MoveFarRight][OpenFarRight][MoveMidRight][OpenRight]Slow[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]slow[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
Quick, quick, slow[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight][MoveMidRight][OpenMidRight][MoveFarRight][OpenRight][MoveRight][OpenRight][MoveMidRight][OpenMidRight][MoveMidRight][OpenMidRight][MoveRight][OpenFarRight][MoveFarRight][OpenFarRight][MoveMidRight][OpenRight][MoveMidLeft][OpenMidLeft]Ah![.][A][CloseSpeechSlow][OpenMidRight][MoveLeft][OpenMidLeft]Y-you[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][CloseSpeechSlow][OpenMidLeft][MoveMidLeft][OpenMidLeft][MoveFarLeft][OpenLeft][MoveLeft][OpenLeft][MoveMidLeft][OpenFarLeft]Not bad[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][CloseSpeechSlow][OpenMidLeft][MoveMidLeft][OpenMidLeft][MoveLeft][OpenFarLeft][MoveFarLeft][OpenFarLeft][MoveMidLeft][OpenMidLeft]No, good[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][CloseSpeechSlow][OpenMidLeft][MoveMidLeft][OpenMidLeft][MoveFarLeft][OpenLeft][MoveLeft][OpenLeft][MoveMidLeft][OpenMidLeft][MoveMidLeft][OpenMidLeft][MoveLeft][OpenFarLeft][MoveFarLeft][OpenFarLeft][MoveMidLeft][OpenMidLeft]Very good actually[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][CloseSpeechSlow][OpenMidLeft][MoveMidLeft][OpenMidLeft][MoveFarLeft][OpenLeft][MoveLeft][OpenLeft][MoveMidLeft][OpenFarLeft]You CAN dance![A][CloseSpeechSlow][OpenFarLeft][MoveFarLeft][OpenFarLeft][0x0080][LoadFace][0x00E][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][MoveMidLeft][OpenMidLeft][0x0080][LoadFace][0x00E][ClearFace][.......][......][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x122][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x124][OpenMidLeft]You're much better than[.]
I imagined you'd be.[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Thank you.[A]
My father was a merchant. We found
ourselves invited to many balls.[A]
It was my job to dance with the wives[.]
and daughters of his associates.[A]
I found that I had a taste for it, and
with practice, I improved my skill.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Is that so? I see[.][ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]It's not
fair you kept that secret.[A]
Your dance skills were quite adequate.[A]
Your treatment of ladies, however, is[.]
still sorely lacking. Next[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]Uh-oh.[.....]
I really have no time to chat.[A]
I must be going.
Farewell.[.][A][OpenMidRight][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][MoveMidLeft][OpenMidLeft]W-wait a minute, Rennac![......]
Ooh![A]
[ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
I don't know why, but[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
I'm quite vexed[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[0D3C]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x122][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x124][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]Sigh[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]Don't you know that it's rude to
sigh when you see someone, Rennac?[A]
You may be a fair dancer, but your
smooth moves belie your gruff manners.[A]
You should learn from me. If you were[.]
truly happy, you would not sigh so.[.][A]
Tell me, Rennac, what is it that
makes you happy?[A][OpenMidRight]Makes me happy?[.][A]
Let me see[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
Uh[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
I've never really thought about it.[.]
If pressed, I'd have to say gold.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Gold, did you say?[A]
So if you had gold, you would[.]
be happy. Is that it?[.][A][OpenMidRight]Well, if you have enough gold, you
can buy whatever you desire.[A]
Mercenaries work so that they can[.]
get paid. It's why they fight.[A]
Knights fight because they have[.]
sworn oaths, but there is more[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
They've been promised a certain social
status by fulfilling their oaths.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]So, by getting what you desire,[.]
you can be happy? Is that it?[.][A][OpenMidRight]What do you mean?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Rather than lament over what you do not[.]
possess, you should treasure what you do.[.][A]
That's a very important lesson to learn,
don't you think?[A]
Isn't that the road to true happiness?[A][OpenMidRight]Princess L'Arachel[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
I know you mean well when[.]
you say things like that.[.][A]
But coming from someone who has[.]
everything, it means very little.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]This has nothing to do with[.]
my station in life.[.][A]
And as for you, what need have you
of money or fame? You have me![A]
Merely serving me must be the[.]
greatest pleasure man can know.[.][A][OpenMidRight][MoveMidRight][OpenMidRight]So, that's what this is about, is it?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Your employer is sweet and lovely.[A]
That is something most people[.]
dream of having.[A]
[ToggleSmile]Surely you cannot aspire to[.]
happiness greater than this.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
I've always wondered, Princess,[.]
how your ego grew so large.[.][A][OpenMidLeft][MoveMidLeft][OpenMidLeft]You complain far too much![A]
Come, Rennac. It's time to go.
Follow me, and try not to lag.[A][OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidRight]Ah, Princess L'Arachel![.][.....]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]Perfect[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
True happiness? Is this really
what happiness feels like?[A]
[0D3D]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x123][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x126][OpenMidLeft]Oh![.][A]
You there, lassie.
Are you lost?[.][A][OpenMidRight]I[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
I'm not lost.[.][A]
I'm traveling with Ephraim.[.]
I'm his[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]friend.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Oho! In that case, you and I
are allies, are we not?[.][A]
My name's Dozla. It's[.]
an honor to meet you![.][A][OpenMidRight]Uh-huh[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft][MoveMidLeft][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Gwah ha ha! You're a
quiet lassie, aren't you?[.][A]
And you're so tiny, too.[A]
Seeing you takes me back to the days
when Princess L'Arachel was a child.[A]
Tell me, lassie, how old are you?[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
It's impolite to ask a woman her
age. That's what Ephraim says.[A]
I think you're being rude.[A][OpenMidLeft][MoveMidLeft][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Gwah ha ha![.]
Aren't you the sassy one![.][A]
You're still young. I don't think you[.]
need to worry about age just yet.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]And how old are you?[A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Me? I'm all of forty-seven
years old.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]And I am[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
1,200 years old. Roughly.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Huh?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][MoveMidLeft][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Gwah ha ha![.]
Stop teasing me, lassie![A]
You don't have to be shy.[.]
Just tell me how old you are.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]I did. And I said I'm[.]
1,200[.][ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]Roughly.[A]
[0D3E]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x123][OpenMidLeft]Hrmph![A]
Princess L'Arachel![.]
Princess L'Arachel! Where are you?[A][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x126][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Oh, lassie.[.]
What luck meeting you here.[.][A]
Do you know where I might[.]
find Princess L'Arachel?[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]I do not.[.][A]
But that's not important.[.]
Where is Ephraim?[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]If it's Prince Ephraim you're after,
just follow the sounds of combat![.][A]
There's no better way to motivate your
troops than to stand by their side![.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]That L'Arachel person is probably[.]
with Ephraim.[.][A]
I saw her next to him speaking to[.]
him on quite familiar terms.[A]
For some reason, it made
my chest feel[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]funny.[A][OpenMidLeft][MoveMidLeft][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Gwah ha ha![.]
It must be love![A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]Love?[.][A]
This feeling is[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]love?[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Mm. I've tasted the sweet and the sour
that life serves up, and I know love.[.][A]
You, my dear, are in love with
Princess L'Arachel![.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]I'm not so sure about that[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[0D3F]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x123][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x126][OpenMidLeft][MoveMidLeft][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Gwah ha ha![.][A]
Are you all right, lassie?[A]
There's no need to worry.[.][A]
No matter how many enemies
pop up, I'll protect you.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I appreciate it[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
I do feel safe when you're nearby[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
Somehow, you remind me of my father.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft][MoveMidLeft][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Gwah ha ha![.]
I get that a lot![.][A]
[ToggleSmile]So tell me, little one, where[.]
is your father, anyway?[.][A][OpenMidRight][HalfCloseEyes][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]My father[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft][MoveMidLeft][OpenMidLeft]Er[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]What's wrong?![A]
Did I ask something that
I shouldn't have?[.][A]
I-I'm sorry, lassie.
Please don't cry[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight][CloseEyes][OpenMidRight]I'm not crying[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
I'm not crying[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]Ah![.]
What do I do?[.][A]
Wait. Just think. I must have run[.]
across something like this before.[A]
When Princess L'Arachel was a babe,[.]
and she would begin to cry[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
She would tug on my beard! That[.]
would always make her happy.[A]
C'mon, lassie, grab a handful of my[.]
beard and give it a good, strong yank![A][OpenMidRight][OpenEyes][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
You are strange, Dozla.[.][A][OpenMidLeft][MoveMidLeft][OpenMidLeft]What?[.][A][OpenMidRight]But you were worried about me.
That makes me happy.[A]
[ToggleSmile]You're a nice person after all.[.][A][ToggleSmile][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft][MoveMidLeft][OpenMidLeft]Gwah ha ha![.]
You've stopped crying.[A]
Hm, that's a good thing.[A][OpenMidRight]Yes.
Thank you.[A]
[0D40]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x124][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x123][OpenMidLeft]Ah[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
Why has fate chosen to
treat me so cruelly?[A][OpenMidRight]Ah, Rennac.[.][A]
You look so pleased to have been
reunited with Princess L'Arachel.[.][A]
I'm glad we're all in one piece![A][OpenMidLeft]You haven't changed, Dozla. Your ability to[.]
misread people still ruins all conversation.[A]
I am lamenting, old man! I am raging
against my horrible misfortune![.][A]
You're a vassal sworn to serve Princess[.]
L'Arachel. You're supposed to be here.[A]
I, however, am not. I'm temporary. Got it?
I'm an employee! I am NOT a vassal![.][A][OpenMidRight][MoveMidRight][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Gwah ha ha! You're just as interesting as[.]
ever. You're still hard to follow, but[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]This is not a conversation for you to[.]
enjoy, and it's not at all hard to follow![A]
It's not that I don't enjoy being in this[.]
army, but traveling with her again[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
I mean, I haven't even been properly
paid for the last job.[A][OpenMidRight]Oh, so it's about money, is it? In
that case, you've no worries, Rennac.[.][A]
All you have to do is see Princess
L'Arachel safely back to Rausten.[.][A]
Once that's done, His Majesty will pay
you any amount you desire.[A][OpenMidLeft]That's what I heard the last time, but do[.]
you have any idea how much I desire?[A]
When he hears it, His Majesty[.]
may very well explode![A][OpenMidRight]Hmm, so about 1,000 gold pieces?[A][OpenMidLeft]Huh? You can't even buy a[.]
proper blade for that price![A][OpenMidRight]What, 5,000 then?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]You've got the wrong number[.]
of zeroes, old man.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Oh, my apologies.[.]
So you want 500 gold, eh?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]No! That's smaller! It cannot get smaller!
I want more! It's 50,000! 50,000 gold![A]
And I'll bend 50,000 ears to get it[.]
if I have to! Someone must listen![A][OpenMidRight]Oh, right. I understand!
You need 50,000 ears, is that it?[.][A]
Very well, when we return to Rausten
we'll get 50,000 people together![.][A]
Wait[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]that's 100,000 ears. Well anyway,[.]
you'll have all the ears you need![A][OpenMidLeft]It's just a figure of speech, old[.]
man. Bah! I was a fool to complain.[.][A]
[0D41]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x124][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x123][OpenMidLeft]Life is[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]a fickle beast,[.]
is it not, old man?[.][A][OpenMidRight]Why are you so solemn, Rennac? You
can't win battles if you've no hope![A][OpenMidLeft]This journey has taught me the hollowness[.]
and the transience of life's pleasures.[.][A]
Ah, to what end do we toil on this
unforgiving earth? Why do we live?[A][OpenMidRight]Why do we live? Well, if you're not[.]
alive, then you're dead, and[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
Er[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]if you're dead, then you
can't eat, and[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
What was I saying?[.....]
I think I must be getting hungry.[.][A]
[ToggleSmile]I wonder what's for dinner.[.]
My belly's a-rumbling![A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]It must be nice to have no worries
other than what to eat, old man.[A]
And not just you, either.[.][A]
I'm sure that a certain young lady
has nothing to worry about, either.[.][A][OpenMidRight]What's that?
Do you mean Princess L'Arachel?[.][A]
[ToggleSmile]That girl believes the world will turn
out just as she envisions it.[.][A]
I doubt if the word [OpenQuote]worry[CloseQuote] even has
any meaning to her in the first place.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]What a completely envious[.]
position to be in.[A]
I may not look it now, but I'm the
son of a wealthy Carcino merchant.[A]
I believed that you could move the
world if you but had the gold.[A]
Money was everything, and with money,[.]
nothing was beyond my reach![A]
I adored money! I loved money! You see?[.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]What good fortune for you that your[.]
father was a thriving merchant.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]That's just it[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]There are people who can
do anything without any money at all[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
She's overbearing and egotistical, yet she
has us all jumping through hoops.[.][A]
That's a skill normal people
don't possess.[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]That's Princess L'Arachel!
She makes the impossible possible![A]
You're with her because she made a
deep impression on you, too, right?[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]A deep impression? It's more like I'm in
shock, and my brain's been frozen.[A][OpenMidRight][MoveMidRight][OpenMidRight]What? Your brain's frozen? That'll never
do! Did you forget to wear a hat?[.][A][CloseSpeechSlow][OpenMidRight][MoveRight][OpenRight]Let me at it. I'll thaw it out.[.][A][OpenMidLeft][MoveMidLeft][OpenMidLeft][MoveFarLeft][OpenFarLeft]Knock it off! I was speaking figuratively!
You know? As in [OpenQuote]not literally[CloseQuote]?[A]
You're too strong to joke around
like that! Stop it![.][A][OpenRight][MoveRight][OpenRight][ToggleSmile]Gwah ha ha![.]
Just teasing you![.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenFarLeft]Sigh[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
What a pair the two of you make[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
You know, you're the only one who can[.]
keep up with Princess L'Arachel, old man.[.][A]
[0D42]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x123][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x124][OpenMidLeft]You know, Rennac. I was just
thinking about something.[.][A]
These battles are tough on an[.]
old man like me.[A]
I might not make it through[.]
to see the end of this.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Where did that come from?[.]
It better not be an omen.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]I want to see Princess L'Arachel
in her wedding dress one day.[.][A]
That's my one wish in life:[.]
to see her happily wed.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Telling me about it isn't[.]
going to make it happen.[A]
Trying to find a worthy prince who's
willing to take Princess L'Arachel?[.][A]
That's no easy task to accomplish.[A][OpenMidLeft]If I end up food for the crows, if
I cannot escort the princess home,[A]
I want you to take care of her for me.[A][OpenMidRight]What? Why? No, I won't do it.[.]
You can't make me! Sorry, but NO![.][A]
You're the vassal, old man. I'm nothing[.]
more than an escort, a thief.[.][A]
When this war's over, I'm going to collect
my pay and then disappear. You got it?[A]
Once Princess L'Arachel settles down,[.]
she'll probably never leave Rausten again.[A]
It's got nothing to do with me.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]That's cold, Rennac[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
I'm disappointed. I'm sure she'll be so[.]
lovely. Princess L'Arachel, the bride[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][CloseSpeechSlow][OpenMidLeft][CloseEyes][OpenMidLeft]If I gently close my eyes, I can envision[.]
what a glorious spectacle it will be.[.][A][OpenMidRight]If all you need is someone to listen,[.]
I'll play along. What kind of spectacle?[A][OpenMidRight][CloseEyes][OpenMidLeft]The loving couple exchanging their sacred[.]
vows. The joyous citizens of Rausten![.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile][OpenQuote]Congratulations, Princess L'Arachel![CloseQuote]
[OpenQuote]Our condolences, Prince.[CloseQuote][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]The newlyweds will smile and wave as the
royal coach passes through the crowds.[A]
Can you see the flowers? The silver and gold
inlay and the gems glittering in the sun?[.][A][OpenMidRight][MoveRight][OpenRight][OpenEyes][OpenRight][ToggleSmile]What? They have a gem-encrusted coach?
Now that's something I must see.[A]
I'll be on the street, waving a flag, then
I'll race up and offer my congratulations![A][ToggleSmile][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft][OpenEyes][OpenMidLeft][MoveLeft][OpenLeft]Would you really?[.]
That's happy news.[A]
Princess L'Arachel will be so surprised[.]
to see you running after them![A][OpenRight]Yeah, and then she'll look at me
with that smug face and say,[A]
[OpenQuote]Oh, Rennac. Whatever are you[.]
doing here?[.][A]
Come along! Fall in and follow us.[CloseQuote][.][A][OpenLeft]And then Princess L'Arachel will set out
across the continent on her honeymoon[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
I've got it! You'll be her guard on her[.]
honeymoon! Fantastic! That's wonderful![.][A][OpenRight][ToggleSmile]N-no! You're getting carried away![A][ToggleSmile][OpenLeft]Now you're a true vassal to Princess
L'Arachel, body and soul. Gwah ha ha![.][A][OpenRight][ToggleSmile]I've got a terrible feeling I'll never
get away from Princess L'Arachel[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][ToggleSmile]
[0D43]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x113][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x125][OpenMidRight]Cormag[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]Sir Duessel.[A][OpenMidRight]Are you well?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]I am as you see me.[.]
Fine in every respect.[A][OpenMidRight]I'm not talking about your flesh.[.]
It's your heart I'm worried for.[A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]I'm here because I made the decision for
myself to leave Grado.[A]
Luckily for me, one of the leaders here[.]
is an old acquaintance of mine.[.][A]
I'm not saying my heart is at ease, but[.]
I have found something to believe in.[.][A]
Something to fight for.[.]
And yet, you[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]I, too, made a choice to be here.[.]
There's no need for your concern.[.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]I believe in myself. Therefore it[.]
matters not where I am.[.][A]
So no matter where I go or what I do,[.]
I'm sure my brother would understand.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Cormag.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]And besides, General Duessel, you're
here in this army with me.[A]
There's no shame in fighting alongside
the man once known as Obsidian.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Mm.[.][A]
Cormag, let us emerge victorious from this
war, for the things we both believe in.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Yes.[A]
[0D44]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x125][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x113][OpenMidRight]Sir Duessel.[A][OpenMidLeft]Well met, Cormag.[.]
I'm impressed by your skills.[.][A][OpenMidRight]They're still far below[.]
yours, General Duessel.[.][A]
By the way, I have a favor I've[.]
been meaning to ask of you.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]What is it? Please tell me.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Your stories tell of a small lance you
carry like a treasure. May I see it?[A][OpenMidLeft]Stories, you say? Am I the subject
of stories now? Interesting.[A]
Here is the lance you're talking about.[.]
Examine it at your leisure.[.][A][OpenMidRight]It[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]It really is[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
It's a Gavaleus[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]Oh! You've heard of Gavaleus, have you?[.][A]
You must know quite a bit about the[.]
crafting of weapons.[A]
This is one of Gavaleus's final works.[A]
I have quite a collection of weapons, but[.]
this is among the most beautiful of them.[.][A]
While it can be used in battle, I would[.]
never dull its shine with blood or dirt.[A]
If I ever use this lance, I vow that it[.]
will be only in my own final hour.[A][OpenMidRight]It shines as though it could light
up the soul of its wielder.[.][A]
You're right. I would hesitate to[.]
stain its beauty with blood, too.[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Ah, so you grasp what I mean?[.][ToggleSmile]
Cormag, you have a discerning eye.[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Thank you.[A]
And yet, I know that I will never[.]
be your equal, General Duessel.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Come, now.[A]
You know, your brother asked to[.]
see this lance once as well.[A][OpenMidRight]My brother?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Yes.[A]
You two are so alike. His comments
mirror your own almost exactly.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Is that so?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]For warriors, our weapons are our lives.
[ToggleSmile]I'm glad to know you understand that.[.][A]
Someday, you'll be a splendid wyvern
knight to equal your brother.[.][A][ToggleSmile]
[0D45]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x125][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x113][OpenMidLeft]Cormag[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
I've something I want to show you.[A]
Here it is. This lance.[.]
What do you think of it?[A][OpenMidRight]My![.][.....] It has such power! It
sends chills down my spine[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
I am not nearly strong enough to
wield a weapon such as this.[A][OpenMidLeft]Hm, you think so? Merely holding this[.]
lance makes me tremble with dread.[A]
Not overly so, but enough to stop[.]
me from wielding it in combat.[A]
This lance[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]It can drive its
wielder to madness.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Madness, you say?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Yes, Cormag. It's a magic weapon of dark
design that's been in my family for ages.[.][A]
Legend states that the leader of our house
must always carry it, but never use it.[.][A]
We are prohibited from wielding it until such[.]
a time as madness itself rules the day.[.][A]
It's part of my legacy, and yet[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]I[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
I made a grave error[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
I allowed Valter to use this lance.[.][A][OpenMidRight]You let Valter[ToggleMouthMove]--[ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]Yes[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]We were in the middle of a battle.[A]
Valter had broken his lance, and when I[.]
wasn't looking he somehow took this one.[A]
From that moment, he was changed[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
He killed everyone[ToggleMouthMove]--[ToggleMouthMove]even retreating men.[A]
I took the lance from him when I realized[.]
what had happened, but it was too late.[.][A]
Madness had awakened within Valter and
was coursing through his body.[A]
From then on, he hungered only for battle[.]
and for blood[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
It's not as though Valter was a gentle lamb[.]
before, but now his appetite for violence[.][A]
increased many times over. It's all[.]
because of this cursed lance.[.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
That odd light playing around the point[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
I thought it looked familiar.[.][A]
It was Valter[.][ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]It's the same light Valter
had in his eyes on the battlefield.[.][A]
Valter's insane because of this lance.
[ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
Sir Duessel, if it please you, would you
let me have this lance?[.][A][OpenMidLeft][MoveMidLeft][OpenMidLeft]What? You?
B-but[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]Are you worried that I will[.]
end up like Valter?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]N-no[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
[ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]This lance[ToggleMouthMove]--[ToggleMouthMove]someone needs to master it.[.]
It's just a feeling I have.[.][A]
A weapon is only as good or evil as[.]
the man who wields it.[A]
In the hands of someone just, it can
be a righteous weapon.[A]
In the hands of the wicked, it's a
danger to all.[A]
Believe me, I have not been seduced[.]
by this lance.[A]
I merely want to see it used for the
purpose for which it was forged.[A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
I understand you, Cormag.[.]
I'm going to let you have it.[.][A]
I have no son. I had not yet decided
to whom I should pass on this legacy.[.][A]
Now I see that leaving it to someone
whom I trust and believe in is best.[A]
As with me, your admiration of weapons
is balanced by a healthy respect.[.][A]
You also have a good eye, and you[.]
possess tremendous strength.[A]
The day you are able to wield this lance
may not be far off at all.[A]
If the madness in this lance can be tamed,
it may very well be a weapon without equal.[.][A]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]I never had the courage to wield it, but
I would love to see it used righteously.[A]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]I am entrusting it to you.
I hope you will use it one day.[.][A][OpenMidRight]I accept your gift, Sir Duessel.[A][Clear]
I would receive it once this battle is
finished and our hearts are calmer.[.][A]
If I were to take it in the heat of[.]
battle, I might become Valter the second.[.][A]
It is a possibility that I cannot dismiss.[A][OpenMidLeft]Yes, I see.[.]
Cormag[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]I'm counting on you.[A]
I look forward to the day I can see[.]
this lance wielded correctly.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Understood.[.][A]
Until that time comes, please try not to
get yourself killed, [.][ToggleSmile]General Duessel![A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Ha![.][A][ToggleSmile]
[0D46]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x125][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x119][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Ah, General Duessel![A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Oh, it's you, Amelia.[.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes![A]
Oh, but you're not injured at[.]
all, are you, General Duessel?[A]
We've all been struggling so hard,
and yet you don't seem tired at all.[A]
You are an impressive man.[A]
It's all I can do simply to stay
alive out here, it feels like.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]What is it?[.][.....]
General Duessel?[A]
Is something wrong?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Oh, um, sorry.
Your[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
From the first time I laid eyes[.]
upon you, your face[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
I was sure I'd seen it before[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]Huh? Is that so?[A]
You mean before now? Or before
I even joined Grado's army?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Yes, that's right, but I can't recall[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
Getting to be my age has its price.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Don't be silly![.][A]
I happen to think you're still
quite young, General Duessel![.][A][OpenMidLeft]Well, now you've got my attention! What[.]
was it you wanted this old soldier for?[.][A][OpenMidRight]It's just that, even among the younger
knights, there's no match for you.[A]
And, uh[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]Ha ha! I'm not so old that you need to
worry about propping up my ego, lass.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Ah[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]uh[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][.....][A][OpenMidRight][CloseEyes][OpenMidRight]I'm sorry.[A][OpenMidLeft]No, no. There's no need to apologize.[.]
[ToggleSmile]I quite enjoy talking to you, in fact.[A]
[ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight][OpenEyes][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I'm sure I'm not the only one in
this army who feels that way, either.[.][A]
The fighting's fierce, Amelia.
You watch yourself![.][A]
When you're near me, I'll make sure[.]
I keep a good eye out for you, too.[.][A]
I'll be there in a flash if you need
me. Go ahead and fight without worry.[.][A][ToggleSmile][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]Ah, y-yes, sir![.]
Thank you very much.[A]
Fighting alongside you, General[.]
Duessel, is a great honor.[A]
Well, I'll be moving on now.[A][OpenMidLeft]Be seeing you![A][OpenMidRight][ClearFace][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
But[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]I just can't remember[.]
where[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[0D47]
[ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x119][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x125][OpenMidRight]Amelia.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]General Duessel.[A][OpenMidRight]It seems like you've grown quite
comfortable with the spear.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Yes, sir! I have, sir.
Thank you.[A][OpenMidRight]You did well to choose the spear as[.]
your weapon. It suits your height well.[.][A]
It also extends your reach and
enables you to strike with force.[.][A]
More force, even, than a sword
could bring to bear in a battle.[A]
All weapons have their own
unique characteristics.[.][A]
You're familiar with the idea that some[.]
weapons are strong against others?[A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Isn't that what they call[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
the weapon triangle?[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes, it is. And from the looks of things,[.]
your affinity for the spear is quite good.[A]
[ToggleSmile]If you continue to practice, you should[.]
continue to improve and grow stronger.[A][OpenMidLeft]Really?[.][.....]
Ah, that makes me happy.[A][OpenMidRight]Mm. To begin with, the spear
is quite a deep weapon[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[ToggleSmile]Yet the attacks comprise three
surprisingly simple movements.[A]
Right step, left step, and thrust.[A][ToggleSmile][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Right step, left step, and thrust[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
I'm following you.[A][OpenMidRight]Excellent.
But listen, Amelia.[.][A][OpenMidLeft][MoveMidLeft][OpenMidLeft]Y-yes?[A][OpenMidRight]Because they are so simple, they are
easy to learn but tough to perfect.[.][A]
They are the strongest and most[.]
pure of techniques.[.][A]
When you practice them, practice
perfecting each gesture.[A]
And remember, the spear is a subtle[.]
and powerful weapon.[A][OpenMidLeft]Yes, sir![.][A][OpenMidRight]Now it goes without saying that other[.]
weapons have their good points, too.[A]
Swords are easy-to-use, all-purpose weapons,
and axes possess devastating strength.[A]
You should learn to use each weapon type.[.][A]
If you can master them all, you'll be[.]
an unstoppable force.[.][A]
That is, of course, if you can overcome[.]
your own natural affinities.[A]
To begin with, you should work on[.]
mastering one weapon type.[A]
Then you can gradually change weapons[.]
until you can use them all.[.][A]
That's what I have done, you understand.[A]
That's called being multi-proficient.[.][A][Clear]
[ToggleSmile]I'd like to tell you more about different[.]
weapons, but that lecture must wait.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]Wow[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
General Duessel, you know so much[.]
about weapons, don't you?[.][A]
I didn't even realize how caught
up I'd become. [.][ToggleSmile]All right![A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft][MoveMidLeft][OpenMidRight]What is it? Where are[.]
you rushing off to?[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I want to practice the things[.]
you've told me about.[.][A]
The basics[ToggleMouthMove]--[ToggleMouthMove]right, left, thrust. Right?[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]Mm, that's correct.[.]
But[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
I'm happy to see you so enthused, but[.]
do you have any reason to rush so?[A][OpenMidLeft]Um, well[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
There's someone[.][ToggleMouthMove]--[ToggleMouthMove]one of the Knights of[.]
Renais[ToggleMouthMove]--[ToggleMouthMove]to whom I do not want to lose.[A][OpenMidRight]Ah.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]It's not that we're going to fight, or
that I want to defeat him or anything[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
It's just that we're kind of keeping track
of the other's progress, and[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[ToggleSmile]It's just a thing we do.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]I see. I think that should prove to[.]
be a good source of motivation then.[A]
Get to it.[A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yes, sir![.][A]
[ToggleSmile]Oh[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]I think I'll, um, go and
practice over there[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
I'd be nervous in front of you, so
[ToggleSmile]I'm going to practice on my own.[A]
I'll be back to show you later.[.][A][ToggleSmile][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]All right. Understood.[A][OpenMidLeft]Great! See you later![.][A][OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][......][OpenMidRight]Ha ha[.][ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]Such energy. I feel energized[.]
just being around her.[A]
She's just a girl now, but someday
she'll be a woman of grace and beauty.[A]
[ToggleSmile][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]Oh, that face[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]where have I[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
[ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A][Clear]
[ToggleMouthMove]!![ToggleMouthMove][.....]
Wait[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]could it be?[A]
Yes! I remember now!
That's definitely it.[.][A]
Amelia! Amelia![.]
Where could she[.][ToggleMouthMove]--[ToggleMouthMove][A][ToggleSmile]
[0D48]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x119][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x125][OpenMidRight][MoveMidRight][OpenMidRight]Amelia! There you are.[A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Oh, General Duessel.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]I've been looking for you.
And now I've found you.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Um, wh-what's happened? I've
never seen you in such a rush.[A][OpenMidRight]There's something I'd like to ask[.][ToggleMouthMove]--[ToggleMouthMove]
No, something I'd like to tell you.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Er, all right.
What is it?[.][A][OpenMidRight]I remembered.[.][A]
I told you that I thought I'd seen
your face before, didn't I?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Uh, yes.[A][OpenMidRight]Well, I remembered.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Oh, is that it?[.][A]
[ToggleSmile]Please don't keep me
waiting, tell me.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][.....]
Amelia. What is your mother's name?[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]![.][ToggleMouthMove][.....]
[ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]My mother[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft][HalfCloseEyes][OpenMidLeft]My mother's name is[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
Melina[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]And what happened to her?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]When I was just a child, she was
stolen away by bandits.[.][A]
My father had already passed away,
so I was totally[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]sniff[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseEyes][OpenMidLeft]I'm sorry[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
[ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidLeft][HalfCloseEyes][OpenMidLeft]I was left[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
all on my own[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft][CloseEyes][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][.....]
I was right[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
You can rest easy, Amelia.
Your mother is alive and well.[A][OpenMidLeft][OpenEyes][OpenMidLeft]What!?[A][OpenMidRight]It happened a few years back.[.][A]
I was leading a patrol near[.]
the Grado border.[.][A]
We unexpectedly rode up on a group of[.]
bandits, and a battle ensued.[.][A]
When we had taken care of the bandits,
we rescued a lone female captive.[.][A]
We figured she had been taken from some[.]
village, but she was in shock.[A]
In fact, her distress was so great, she[.]
had forgotten much about herself.[.][A]
Her body was in such a weakened[.]
state that she could barely walk.[.][A]
We felt such pity for her that we took
her to a peaceful village we knew of.[.][A]
There, we set up a home for her where[.]
she could recover and live quietly.[.][A]
Some years later, she was restored
to her former vitality.[.][A]
Slowly, she began to recall the lost
memories of her past.[.][A]
Only recently did she remember that[.]
she had once had a daughter.[A]
I took time off from my duties and visited
the village where she had lived.[A]
But the villagers told me her daughter
had left the village some time ago.[.][A]
With no clues as to the girl's whereabouts,[.]
I'd almost given up hope of finding her.[A]
And then, in the strangest of places[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft][MoveLeft][OpenLeft]I-it can't be! Th-that woman[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
What is her name?[.][A][OpenMidRight]Her name is Melina[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][......]
[ToggleSmile]Amelia, she's your mother.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenLeft]What!?[......]
Are you[.][ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]Are you sure?[.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes, I am. I see Melina's[.]
face reflected in your own.[.][A]
There's no mistake.[.][.....]
Isn't it wonderful, Amelia?[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenLeft][HalfCloseEyes][OpenLeft]My[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]mother[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenLeft][CloseEyes][OpenLeft][MoveLeft][OpenLeft]Sniff[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
[ToggleSmile]Thank you[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][ToggleSmile] Thank you[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]Mm[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenLeft][MoveLeft][OpenLeft]Sniff[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]aaa[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
[OpenLeft][MoveLeft][OpenLeft][MoveLeft][OpenLeft]Aaa[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]waaaaaaa!![A][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]Amelia[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenLeft][MoveLeft][OpenLeft]Waa[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
[ToggleSmile]Thank[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][ToggleSmile]you[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][Clear]
Waaa[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][....] [.][ToggleSmile]Thank[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][ToggleSmile][.....]you[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
[......]Sniff[.][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight][HalfCloseEyes][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I, uh, I'm so happy[.]
for you, Amelia[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
Sniff[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
Oh, no.[.][A][Clear][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight][CloseEyes][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Old age must have loosened
these dry, old tear ducts[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
Sniff[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]sniff[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][ToggleSmile]
[0D49]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x125][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x129][OpenMidLeft]Don't tell me you've joined[.]
up here as well, have you?[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]General Duessel.[A]
Prince Lyon no longer holds the capital.[A]
My reason for remaining is gone[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]Knoll, I have something[.]
I would ask you.[A]
What exactly happened to
His Majesty and Prince Lyon?[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
Do you have the courage to
hear that answer?[.][A]
I think perhaps that it will not
be an answer you want to hear.[A][OpenMidLeft]What does that mean?[A][OpenMidRight]Are you familiar with a certain foreign[.]
anecdote of comedic nature?[.][A]
It involves two starving men
and a single loaf of bread.[.][A]
If they break the loaf in two,
both men will die of starvation[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]Knoll, I'm not asking for a riddle.[.]
Let's not waste any more time here.[.][A]
I'm ready to hear the truth. Nothing
you tell me could surprise me.[A][OpenMidRight]If that is your wish, General[.]
Duessel[.][ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]I will speak frankly.[.][A]
This is something that Prince[.]
Lyon does not know.[.][A]
Something that no one should know.[A]
[0D4A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x125][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x129][OpenMidRight]We students of ancient magic, along[.]
with Prince Lyon himself,[.][A]
were researching certain arcane[.]
techniques lost long ago.[.][A]
We were able to reproduce one[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]
phenomenon, but only briefly.[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]I should be more concise.[.][A]
Prince Lyon and I pierced the[.]
veil that clouds our futures.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]What? You[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]could see into
the future?[.][A]
How is that possible? What magic
is powerful enough to[.][ToggleMouthMove]--[ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]Time is like the water of a river:
it flows ever on, never stopping.[.][A]
Certain disturbances can cause ripples
that speed swiftly downstream.[A]
If you can see the water, you can read
the flow, the ripples, the waves.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Hmm[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]It is possible, General. Possible[.]
and, at times, easy. Just think of it:[A]
If you knew a storm was coming in advance,
you could evacuate everyone in its way.[.][A]
If you could see what was to come, you
could help those who might have died.[.][A]
Prince Lyon explained this to us with[.]
much joy in his voice and heart.[A]
His power would, at long last, be able
to help the citizens of Grado.[A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]We continued our work. There were[.]
ceremonies, rituals[.][ToggleMouthMove]--[ToggleMouthMove]such horrors[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
And then we saw it.[.][A]
In the near future, Grado would be
ravaged by catastrophe.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]A catastrophe? Do you[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]No, it's not the conflict in which
we are currently embroiled.[.][A]
This event is still in our future.[A]
We saw Grado. We saw the earth
crumble. We saw our people dying.[.][A]
We saw the shape our future would take.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]What?[.]
That's madness[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]Idiocy![.][A]
I've lived a long life, and I've
never heard of anything like that.[A]
Not ever.[.][A][OpenMidRight]I am not surprised that you do not
believe me, General.[A]
We could not believe it, either. We[.]
tried to disprove what we had seen.[.][A]
But nothing could shake the vision.[.][A]
In this disaster, Grado would be
destroyed. Countless would die.[.][A]
Those who died quickly would be[.]
spared the slow horror of starvation.[.][A]
This was when the emperor died, by the
way. Lyon was shattered by despair.[.][A]
He devoted himself to research, and[.]
then came the Dark Stone[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]So that's what happened?[A]
Is that when the decision[.]
to invade Renais was made?[A][OpenMidRight]I don't know.[.][A]
Only one person knows[.]
the truth behind that.[A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]I have told you only the
truths I have seen.[.][A]
[0D4B]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x125][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x129][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]Knoll.[A][OpenMidRight]Is that you, General Duessel?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]You're tired, aren't you?[.]
Worn to the bone.[.][A]
I understand how you feel, but on the[.]
battlefield, this only invites death.[.][A][OpenMidRight]You are probably right[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
And yet that might be best.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]What are you planning to
do from here on?[A][OpenMidRight]I do not know[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
I have lost my way.[.][A]
Perhaps I should have been
executed in the capital.[A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]I once studied dark magic[.]
alongside Prince Lyon.[A]
He was such a gentle soul. You could
see it[ToggleMouthMove]--[ToggleMouthMove]he was too kind to survive.[.][A]
Prince Lyon dreamt of finding happiness[.]
for all of Grado's citizens.[A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]And now, Prince Lyon is no more.[A]
I have lost everything.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]I have also lost everything.[A]
And we have both lost our ways.[.][A]
We are dead men who have stayed[.]
too long away from our graves.[A]
But remember, Knoll[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
You cannot see the future, but you
can look back at your past.[.][A]
Look and learn. And remember.[.][A]
What gave your life meaning, and what[.]
has taken meaning from you now?[.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]If you still hold the convictions that
guided you in Grado, you can start anew.[A]
That[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]That is what I must do.[.][A]
We may be diminished by our shame, but
we are not dead yet, my friend.[.][A][OpenMidRight]General Duessel[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
I am not as strong as you.[A]
Still, [.][ToggleSmile]I believe you are right.
I, too, shall search for a new path.[A][Clear]
[ToggleSmile]A path that guides me to realizing the
dreams Prince Lyon once held so dear.[.][A]
