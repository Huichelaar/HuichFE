V & T in frame.

T
What's with the ghoulish face?
V
Motion... Sick...ness. Urp!
V RUNS PAST T AND OUT OF FRAME. T MOVES LEFT.
T
Yeee-ikes. You sure you're not a phantom in disguise?
V
I might... not get along well with the ocean, but... oh gods!
V RUNS OUT OF FRAME AGAIN.
T
Not making a strong case there.
V
I'm crossing the ocean still. Cut me some slack; Have you even seen a phantom talk before?
T
No, but I have never seen a human do so whilst vomiting either.
V
I wouldn't miss an opportunity to prove you wrong.
T
It's that dedication that worries me sometimes, you know?
V
Oh ir's nothing like... that... Urp!
V RUNS OUT OF FRAME AGAIN.
T
[smile]Uh-huh...
So, hey, I got some good news and even better news for you.
V
The bar *is* low right now... shoot.
T
You sound reluctant to hear it.
V
[closeeyes]*ahem*
Dear sir Johnny 'Gino' Solis, would you be so kind to indulge... me in...[eyesopen] FOR PETE'S!
V RUNS OUT OF FRAME AGAIN.
T
Why yes, how could I refuse such an honest request?
The good news is that we'll arrive in just three more days.
V
That's neither good, nor news!
Now I dread to hear what the even better news is supposed to be.
T
The even better news is... THIS!
T BUMPS INTO V. V SHAKES. T RUNS BACK.
V
What... did you just shove into my hands?
T
I think it's one of those things you're good at.
V
Vomiting?
T
It's a puzzle.
V
Did you take this from the hull?
T
Nooooo? Just enjoy the present, Vivian.
V
My conscience would keep distracting me.
T
Just don't let anyone see you have it. I've prepared my alibi; handing it to the captain will only draw suspicion onto you. Toodles!
T RUNS OUT OF FRAME. V MOVES A LITTLE TO THE LEFT.
V
You absolute... I should've figured the even better news... I guess I'll just take a peek then.
PUZZLE STARTS

[thought]Is this... a weapon? Looks valuable. I'll just mix it with the others and say it's Gino's.

OSIAN ENTERS FROM RIGHT
O
Feeling any better, Vivian?
V
Oh! Hey Osian. Surprised me there. When'd you get here?
O
Just now. Did you get it out of your system?
V
Right! Err... well, breakfast and lunch yeah. Still waiting for dinner.
O
I was referring to your anxiety.
V
That one's probably going to stay inside.
O
I get it's a large responsibility, but shape up. You'll be furthest from the enemy.
V
I know that, but that's only relative to you all. You're all going to face Desalo directly.
O
And we joined this expedition knowing that full well. Why did you join?
V
I'm from Arzil. When Desalo took over... When I left, I abandoned my friends and family. From everything I've heard, Desalo punishes anyone even remotely related to their enemies. I owe it to my family to do something to make things right.
O
That's honourable, but then you'll have to first beat your current foe.
V
Pardon?
O
You can't do anything for those you left behind, if you can't suppress your anxiety.
V
Yes, yes. Easier said than done, but yes.
O
Some extra sleep could help. You should call it an early night.
V
[smile]Who knows, maybe I'll get to keep dinner.
O
Rest well, Vivian.
V
Good night, Osian.
