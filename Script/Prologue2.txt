V & T in frame.

T
What's with the ghoulish face?
V
Motion... Sick...ness. Urp!
V RUNS PAST T AND OUT OF FRAME. T MOVES LEFT.
T
Yeee-ikes. You sure you're not a phantom in disguise?
V
I might... not get along well with the sea, but... oh gods!
V RUNS OUT OF FRAME AGAIN.
T
Not making a strong case there.
V
I'm crossing the sea still. Cut me some slack; Have you even seen a phantom talk before?
T
No, but I have never seen a human do so whilst vomiting either.
V
I wouldn't miss an opportunity to prove you wrong.
T
It's that dedication that worries me sometimes, you know?
V
Oh ir's nothing like... that... Urp!
V RUNS OUT OF FRAME AGAIN.
T
[smile]Uh-huh...
So, hey, I got some good news and even better news for you.
V
The bar *is* low right now... shoot.
T
You sound reluctant to hear it.
V
[closeeyes]*ahem*
Dear sir Johnny 'Gino' Solis, would you be so kind to indulge... me in...[eyesopen] FOR PETE'S!
V RUNS OUT OF FRAME AGAIN.
T
Why yes, how could I refuse such an honest request?
The good news is that we'll arrive in just three more days.
V
That's neither good, nor news!
Now I dread to hear what the even better news is supposed to be.
T
The even better news is... THIS!
T BUMPS INTO V. V SHAKES. T RUNS BACK.
V
What... did you just shove into my hands?
T
I think it's one of those things you're good at.
V
Vomiting?
T
It's a puzzle.
V
Did you take this from the hull?
T
Nooooo? Just enjoy the present, Vivian.
V
My conscience would keep distracting me.
T
Just don't let anyone see you have it. I've prepared my alibi; handing it to the captain will only draw suspicion onto you. Toodles!
T RUNS OUT OF FRAME. V MOVES A LITTLE TO THE LEFT.
V
You absolute... I should've figured the even better news... I guess I'll just take a peek then.
PUZZLE STARTS

[thought]Is this... a weapon? Looks valuable. I'll just mix it with the others and say it's Gino's.

OSIAN ENTERS FROM RIGHT
O
Feeling any better, Vivian?
V
Oh! Hey Osian. Surprised me there. When'd you get here?
O
Just now. Did you get it out of your system?
V
Right! Err... well, breakfast and lunch yeah. Still waiting for dinner.
O
I was referring to your anxiety.
V
That one's probably going to stay inside.
O
I get it's a large responsibility, but shape up. You'll be furthest from the enemy.
V
I know that, but that's only relative to you all. You're all going to face Desalo directly.
O
And we joined this expedition knowing that full well. Why did you join?
V
I'm from Arzil. When Desalo took over... When I left, I abandoned my friends and family. From everything I've heard, Desalo punishes anyone even remotely related to their enemies. I owe it to my family to do something to make things right.
O
That's honourable, but then you'll have to first beat your current foe.
V
Pardon?
O
You can't do anything for those you left behind, if you can't suppress your anxiety.
V
Yes, yes. Easier said than done, but yes.
O
Some extra sleep could help. You should call it an early night.
V
[smile]Who knows, maybe I'll get to keep dinner.
O
[closeeyes]Rest well, Vivian.
V
Good night, Osian.

THE NEXT MORNING
VINCENT MAPSPRITE RUNS TOWARDS DEMI AND ML MAPSPRITE.

V
Commander, land ho!
D
What!? That doesn't make sense. We shouldn't arrive for another two days.
V
I couldn't make out any forest nearby. I don't think we are approaching Til.
D
Not good. ML, wake the others. Vincent, you and I will be paying the captain a visit.
ML
Yes, ma'am.
V
Roger.

SCENE SWITCH

ML
*knock* WAKE UP. Action Stations!
Viv
Wh-What's going on?
ML
We're off course. Gather at the deck.
ML DISAPPEARS
Viv
Wait, what does that mean? How did we get off course?

FADE TO MAP, FOLLOW VIVIAN TO DECK WHERE OTHER MAPSPRITES ARE PRESENT.

Viv
Osian, what's happening, why is everyone gathered here?
O
Not sure, ML told me we're off course and sent me here. He/She's never been one to elaborate.
GINO MOVES INTO VIEW
T
Osian, sir, uhm... I've got some bad news.
O
Let's hear it.
Viv
Oh no...
T
Well, I happened to be near the hull, you know, for...
O
Don't care about your excuses, get to the point.
T
There's explosives in the hull of the ship.
Viv
What!?
T
I disabled all I could find, but we should disembark ASAP.
O
I'll inform Demi. You two... just stay put.
Viv
Sir, we need to abandon ship!
O
And swim to Til? We won't reach land for another two days. You're panicking.
T
Umm actually, you should look behind you, sir.
O
...
Viv
No, sir, he's not pulling your leg. You have to see this.
O
...
OSIAN TURNS AROUND
O
...Land?
