V:
Yep, I'm sure of it now.

C:
What?

V:
They don't like me. I'm still debating what their opinion is of you.

C:
This again? Why do you expect them to get chummy with you? They're here to guard us, not to befriend us. Besides, talking about them behind their back when they're in hearing distance is probably not helping.

V:
Well, can you blame me for trying? These people are armed and trained. If I at least know them a little I would feel more at ease. It's like they're trying to stay as distant as possible, whilst physically occupying the same space as me... us.

C:
Just military standard procedure.

V:
It also doesn't help that we're underground in a cave that recently collapsed.

C:
Yes, I remember a week ago when you begged me to bring you along. What happened to that Vivian?

V:
She didn't know her first excavation would be wrought in danger and dread. You could have given her a heads up.

C:
No, she would've definitely come along either way. You know what? I think I've got something to take your mind off things. I found this recently, seems to be a sort of puzzle. Take a break and see if you can solve it.

V:
Not one of these again. Please don't tell me it's a riddle. You are aware that not everyone younger than you is a child, yes?

C:
Nothing of the sort. Just give it a look, I've got some grown up stuff to do.

V:
What did I just...
And he's off.
...
...
Well... maybe a peek then.

What is the meaning of this? Did this puzzle just-
Wait, why does this look like a weapon? Cosimo, just what...

V:
I give up. I've never been a fan of these hackneyed
flip-puzzles.

C:
Vivian!

V:
Cosimo, hey great timing, about that puzzle-

C:
We're going back up. No time to explain.

V:
What? What about the excavation, the ruins, the-

C:
Already over, we got what we came for, time to move.

V:
That's not how an excavation works, I didn't even get to-

S:
HELP!

C:
Seems like they're here already.

V:
Why does everybody KEEP interrupting-
Wait, who's here?

S:
We're being attacked by bandits! Where's commander N? Where are your escorts?

C:
They're still back there, caught by the spirit of adventure, no doubt.

S:
What in tarnation came over them? You two, stay here and hide whilst I get them.

C:
Alright, now off we go.

V:
Huh? Are you crazy? Did you hear what he just said?

C:
No-one is back there; our escorts have already departed this world. Stay if you will, but I have no intention of following them to the next.

V:
Wait, what happened to them? What in the blazes is going on?
Oh, for Pete's sake!
