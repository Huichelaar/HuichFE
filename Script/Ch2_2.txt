CAPTAIN AND CH3 BOSS TALK

Alvin
What happened? I didn't hear any bang.
Captain
The explosives might have been disabled.
A
How'd that happen?
C
Someone must have found them.
A
You weren't guarding them?
C
I was lucky to even find a moment where I could escape undetected. What was I supposed to do, guard the explosives until they detonate? That'd be suicide!
A
You were supposed to detonate the explosives. They didn't detonate.
C
I led them to Ese Neve. This is why there was a back-up plan, right?
A
[closeeyes]... You're not supposed to rely on the fact there's a back-up plan. [openeyes] That's what made your execution ham-fisted. [pause] You'll be given a second chance.
C
No! Please, I-

ALVIN KILLS MAPSPRITE CAPTAIN

A
Alright people. Let this be a lesson to any of you who were thinking of slacking. There is no back-up plan. Fail here, and you'll be joining captain.

SCENE SWITCH TO VIV & CO KNOCKING ON THERESA'S DOOR

Viv
Uhm...
S
They're your friends, right? Knock.
Viv
Right, right...
*KNOCK SFX*
Offscreen
Who's there?
Viv
Theresa!? It's me, Vivian!
Offscreen
Wait... What!?
*DOOR OPEN SFX*, THERESA APPEARS
T
Deary me, it really is! How are you here?
S
Excuse me, but could we enter?
T
Oh yes, of course!

SCENE SWITCH

T
So Viv, how'd you get here?
Viv
Uhm... So I joined the resistance.
T
You... You did?
S
I'm going to have to speed this along. We're a resistance platoon. We're moving through Arzil now as part of an excursion to destroy a catalyst. Our pursuers are still around. We came here mostly to take shelter.
V
I'm sorry Theresa, the original plan didn't involve any of this.
T
[smile]It's fine, I'm glad you're still alive!
V
[nosmile]Theresa, my dad, do you know if he's ok?
T
Port Cryfin is still cordoned off. Hardly any information gets through. I haven't heard anything about either of you. Vivian, you were there when they invaded, right? What happened?
V
Oh it was a horrible experience. It's a long story but-
I if alive, otherwise ML, moves into frame.
Too long, I'm sure. I've been keeping a lookout. More and more people have been gathering.
S
Is this place usually busy?
T
No, we're on the outskirts of Tryza. Most business is further north from here.
I
They appear to be approaching the house.
S
Must be the enemy then. No shelter for us, I guess. Sorry, lady, we've attracted undeserved attention to your house.
T
It's fine! You've done nothing wrong.
S
Thanks for the support. Everyone, we're moving out. We'll head south, once we break through the enemy formation. Vivian, you lead again.
V
Y-Yes, sir!

SCENE SWITCHES TO OUTSIDE

I if alive, otherwise ML.
We're quite surrounded.
C if alive.
Good. That means it'll be easier to break through any specific part of their formation.
S if C alive
That's not quite how it works, but I like your optimism.
S if C not alive.
We will be just fine.

THERESA EXITS THE HOUSE

Viv
Theresa! What are you doing!? You should head back inside and lock the door.
T
Vivian, Herbert...
Herbert is still doing[N]
groceries in town.[AN]
He could return any minute.[AN]
What if these people attack[N]
him and he gets hurt?[AN]
[ML]
R-right[TMM]...[TMM][.4] In any case,[N]
we need to move.[AN]
Let's try to stick[N]
together and find him.[AN]
[FR][BoxHeight][0x1]
Yes. I've brought my bow![AN]
[CloseSpeech]
[FR][BoxHeight][0x2]
He'll be fine. He'll be fine.[AN]
[HalfCloseEyes][TMM]...[TMM][.6][AN]
Gods, if anything were[N]
to happen to him[TMM]...[TMM][AN]
[ML][BoxHeight][0x1]
Theresa, we need to move![AN]
[FR]
[OpenEyes]Y-yes! Right away![AN]

CAMERA MOVES TO AIDEN BOSS.

Alright everyone. They're surrounded.
You know the drill, leave none alive.

the [Red]village entrance, up north[Red].[AN]
We don't want more people[N]
getting involved in this.[AN]
[R][BoxHeight][0x1]
Yes ma'am![AN]
[X]

SOLDIER MOVES NORTH AND SPAWNS SOME OTHER ENEMIES.

T
They're at the stairway.
That's the route Herbert
takes to the store!
ML
That's north. We're
supposed to go south.
T
Vivian!
Viv
Yes, I'm thinking up
a strategy, ok?
I'll find a way
to get Herbert.
I promise.
ML
We can't linger.
V
Simon, none of us have been in
Arzil the past two years.
If we rescue Herbert, he could
provide us with valuable intel.
T
My lips are sealed until you get him!
ML
You would jeopardise-
S
Alright. Do as you do best, Vivian.

[ML][TextSpeed][0xF]
[CloseEyes]...[.5][OpenEyes] Where's Theresa?[AN]
[MR]
Looking for you.[AN]

We're actually resistance.[AN]
[ML][CloseEyes]
Of course you are.[AN]
[OpenEyes]
Vivian, If anything[N]
happens to Theresa[TMM]...[TMM][AN]
[MR]
I know. She's not part of this[N]
conflict. I won't let her die.[AN]
[ML]
No[.5], you made her part[N]
of this conflict.[AN]
Desalo's not going to be[N]
merciful to anyone involved.[AN]
[MR][BoxHeight][0x1]

[ML]
Hold up, one thing at a time.
Vivian's... she's still...[.6][CloseEyes]
Go figure.
[MR]
Oh,[.4] no need to hide
your disappointment.
We're going to help
her out. 
[ML]
No, we should leave!
[MR]
Herbert, this is our
chance to fight back!
Never has there been
a better opportunity!
[ML]
Did Vivian talk you into this?
Yes, it's our best chance.
No, it's not a good chance.
[MR]
She didn't and too bad;
I'm taking it regardless.
[ML]
...
[MR]
Not leaving yet?
[ML][CloseEyes]
...join.
[MR]
What was that? You have
to speak up, Herbert.
[ML][OpenEyes]
I said I'll join you.
[MR]
Glad to have you onboard!

Nothing dear!

Viv
Hey Herbert! Err... long time no...
Wait why are you charging at me?
Oh gods!

Don't you run!
This is all your fault.
Stand and collect your

Herbert, We only made it out of[N]

I'd argue we did [Font][0x3]despite[Font][0x1][N]
her instructions.[AN]
Regardless, what exactly
are you doing here?

We're here to destroy a catalyst.
We assume it's at Til forest.

You have fun with that then.

SOMEONE IN THE PARTY TRIES TO ESCAPE
BUT HERBERT WASN'T RECRUITED YET

T
You're not going to abandon
Herbert, are you?


SOMEONE IN THE PARTY ESCAPED. CHAPTER ENDS

Aiden
We let one slip by.
Alright everyone, retreat.
We got bigger issues now.

SWITCH MAPS

C if alive, otherwise Viv
Why'd they suddenly retreat?
S
I'm not sure, but I'm not
taking any chances;
We'll move further south.

HERBERT THERESA VIVIAN TALK HAPPENS NOW

SWITCH MAPS

I if alive, otherwise S
This should be far enough.
S
Alright, then we'll set
up camp here.


H
Pardon, Vivian told me you're
in charge of this platoon?
S
Yes, I don't believe we've met.
I'm Simon. I'm glad to finally
meet you, Herbert.
H
Pleasure's all mine.
S
Thanks again for helping us out.
Send my regards to Theresa as well.
H
Will do.
S
Could I ask you something?
H
Go ahead.
S
Unlike our enemy, we were unprepared.
We were betrayed and crashed quite
a distance from our goal.
Despite our small platoons, we
were still found.
H
True. None of those statements
were questions though.
S
Having established that
Desalo's got us outwitted,
how come his troops retreated?
H
How much do you know about Desalo?
S
We have not managed to keep an eye
out consistently from our base.
H
In the few years he's reigned so far,
Desalo's not been without his quirks.
One of them is his love for absolutes.
Another his tendency to execute
draconian punishment.
You fought sellswords. They can't
refuse an assignment by Desalo,
but they're not exactly loyal.
I imagine they failed their job
as soon as even one of you escaped.
All that awaits now is punishment.
Knowing this, they abandoned the job.
S
So much for that. I would've expected
more from someone like Desalo.
H
He's still got cards left. You know
about his more loyal followers, right?
S
Do go on.
