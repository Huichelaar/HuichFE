THE NEXT MORNING
VINCENT MAPSPRITE RUNS TOWARDS DEMI AND ML MAPSPRITE.

V
Commander, land ho!
D
What!? That doesn't make sense. We shouldn't arrive for another two days.
V
I couldn't make out any forest nearby. I don't think we are approaching Til.
D
Not good. ML, wake the others. Vincent, you and I will be paying the captain a visit.
ML
Yes, ma'am.
V
Roger.

SCENE SWITCH

ML
*knock* WAKE UP. Action Stations!
Viv
Wh-What's going on?
ML
We're off course. Gather at the deck.
ML DISAPPEARS
Viv
Wait, what does that mean? How did we get off course?

FADE TO MAP, FOLLOW VIVIAN TO DECK WHERE OTHER MAPSPRITES ARE PRESENT.

Viv
Osian, what's happening, why is everyone gathered here?
O
Not sure, ML told me we're off course and sent me here. He/She's never been one to elaborate.
GINO MOVES INTO VIEW
T
Osian, sir, uhm... I've got some bad news.
O
Let's hear it.
Viv
Oh no...
T
Well, I happened to be near the hull, you know, for...
O
Don't care about your excuses, get to the point.
T
There's explosives in the hull of the ship.
Viv
What!?
T
I disabled all I could find, but we should disembark ASAP.
O
I'll inform Demi. You two... just stay put.
Viv
Sir, we need to abandon ship!
O
And swim to Til? We won't reach land for another two days. You're panicking.
T
Umm actually, you should look behind you, sir.
O
...
Viv
No, sir, he's not pulling your leg. You have to see this.
O
...
OSIAN TURNS AROUND
O
...Land?


DEMI AND VINCENT MAPSPRITES APPEAR
D
Everyone! We're about to land at Ese Neve. The captain is missing and the ship's course has been locked in. We're also missing a safety boat. We've likely been betrayed by the captain.
T
Ma'am! There are explosives on board!
Vin
We have *definitely* been betrayed.
THUD NOISE. EARTHQUAKE EFFECT. SHIP HAS LANDED
D
...
Alright. Everyone disembark! Be prepared; We are likely walking into an ambush.
DEMI DISAPPEARS OUT OF FRAME
Vin
*Definitely* walking into an ambush.

SCENE SWITCHES TO CH1 MAP. CAPTAIN AND CH1 BOSS TALK

Turner
What happened? I didn't hear any bang.
Captain
The explosives might have been disabled.
T
How'd that happen?
C
Someone must have found them.
T
You weren't guarding them?
C
I was lucky to even find a moment where I could escape undetected. What was I supposed to do, guard the explosives until they detonate? That'd be suicide!
T
You were supposed to detonate the explosives. They didn't detonate.
C
I led them to Ese Neve. This is why there was a back-up plan, right?
T
[closeeyes]... You're not supposed to rely on the fact there's a back-up plan. [openeyes] That's what made your execution ham-fisted. [pause] You'll be given a second chance.
C
No! Please, I-

TURNER KILLS MAPSPRITE CAPTAIN

T
Alright people. Let this be a lesson to any of you who were thinking of slacking. There is no back-up plan. Fail here, and you'll be sent to wherever the captain went.

SCENE SWITCHES TO SEPARATE MAP WITH OUR HEROES

ML
That's everyone Ma'am.
D
Good.
ML
Gino, you're sure there were explosives on board?
T
You bet your bippy.
Vin
Then I guess you got them all, considering the ship is whole. Or was the captain just smuggling explosives?
D
I doubt that. They took a safety boat. I think the plan had always been to get us all killed in an explosion.
Vin
If all the explosives have been taken care of, shouldn't we sail back home?
T
I can't guarantee they've *all* been disabled.
ML
Not to mention,
we don't have anyone else with any knowledge of sailing this ship.
D
Here's what we're going to do. We will stick to our original plan and head to Til forest. Instead of arriving there by boat, we will traverse the final stretch by foot. As we're likely walking into an ambush, we'll split into three groups.
T
How will we defend ourselves if we reduce our numbers like that?
D
We won't. The point is that smaller groups will have an easier time slipping past the enemy. Furthermore, if one group gets found and routed, the others can still make it. Here's the groups: Gino and Vincent, you two will take the most direct path to Til, southwest.
T
That's the most guarded path!
D
Hence why you're group is the smallest. This is also the second time you've interrupted me, Gino. Vincent will lead.
Vin
We'll be fine, Gino. We can just fly over enemies and terrain alike. None will touch us.
T
You're underestimating the reach of a bow.
D
Listen, I get you're worried, and you have every right to be. However, now is not the time to argue. On to group two. Linda, Carmen, you'll be joining me. We're going to head south, then west.
L
Understood.
D
Everyone else is in group three. Simon, you will lead this group. You'll go west, then south.
S
Yes'm.
D
We will meet up X days from now in Til forest. If you get there early, hide and wait until the other groups arrive. Once the deadline arrives, we will strike with everyone who has made it. Disperse!
