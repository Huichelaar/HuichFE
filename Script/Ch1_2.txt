DEMI AND VINCENT MAPSPRITES APPEAR
D
Everyone! We're about to land at Ese Neve. The captain is missing and the ship's course has been locked in. We're also missing a safety boat. We've likely been betrayed by the captain.
T
Ma'am! There are explosives on board!
Vin
We have *definitely* been betrayed.
THUD NOISE. EARTHQUAKE EFFECT. SHIP HAS LANDED
Viv
What was that?
D
We've landed. Everyone disembark! Be prepared; We are likely walking into an ambush.
DEMI DISAPPEARS OUT OF FRAME
Vin
*Definitely* walking into an ambush.

SCENE SWITCHES TO SEPARATE MAP WITH OUR HEROES

ML
That's everyone Ma'am.
D
Good.
ML
Gino, you're sure there were explosives on board?
T
You bet your bippy.
Vin
Then I guess you got them all, considering the ship is whole. Or was the captain just smuggling explosives?
D
I doubt that. They left in a safety boat. I think the plan had always been to get us all killed in an explosion.
Vin
If all the explosives have been taken care of, shouldn't we sail back home?
T
I can't guarantee they've *all* been disabled.
ML
Not to mention,
we don't have anyone else with any knowledge of sailing this ship.
D
Here's what we're going to do. We will stick to our original plan and head to Til forest. Instead of arriving there by boat, we will traverse the final stretch by foot. As we're likely walking into an ambush, we'll split into three groups.
Vin
How will we defend ourselves if we reduce our numbers like that?
D
We won't. We will avoid confrontation as much as possible. Smaller groups will have an easier time slipping past the enemy. Furthermore, if one group gets found and routed, the others can still make it. Gino and Vincent, you two will take the most direct path to Til, southwest.
Vin
That's likely the most guarded path!
D
Hence why your group is the smallest. This is also the second time you've interrupted me, Vincent. Gino will lead.
T
We'll be fine, Vin. You can just fly over enemies and terrain alike. None will touch us.
Vin
That's not quite how it works.
D
Now is not the time to argue. On to group two. Simon will be in charge of this group. Vivian, ML, Carmen, Isabel, You're all in this group. You'll head west, then south.
S
Yes'm.
D
Everyone else is in group three, which I'll lead. We will head south, then west. X days from now, we will meet up in Til forest. Then, we will strike with all of us who made it through. Questions? Alright. Form groups and disperse!

SCENE SWITCH TO CH1 MAP

Isabel
Heads up, we're being surrounded.
Viv
We've been found then?
I
Not necessarily, but we will inevitably run into some enemies now.
S
Alright, we'll prepare for battle then. Vivian, unpack.
Viv
Oh gods...
ML
Hey, where's my weapon?
Viv
Yeah, sorry I seem to somehow have... misplaced your weapon.
ML
You can't be serious.
Viv
I've got this one though.
ML
Whose is this?
Viv
I got it from the sh- I mean, Gino gave it to me.
ML
And you didn't give it back when we split?
Viv
He gave it to me, but I've got a spare, so please.
S
What's taking so long?
ML
She misplaced my weapon.
Viv
We sorted it out though, didn't we?
ML
[eyesclose]...Can't believe he picked you.
ML MOVES OUT OF FRAME
Viv
Guess not...
S
Vivian.
Viv
Yeah, Simon?
S
You'll be handing out orders for this fight.
Viv
Wha- You... You were serious about that?
S
I've already informed the others. I know you can do it. Good luck!
Viv
*Oh* gods...

BACKGROUND FADES OUT, MAP FADES IN, ENEMIES APPEAR, CURSOR HOVERS OVER VIVIAN.

Viv
Alright, considering how they've moved so far... Their leader is probably the one furthest back. We defeat... we kill that one, and we should be able to scurry past the grunts.

CURSOR TO ENEMY BOSS

Turner
Rubbish! These can't be their main troops. Figures I'd be stuck with leftovers. Alright everyone, let loose! Won't be any trouble with these numbers.

I'm sorry, but I can't give shelter.[N]
All I can give you is this.[AN]
This weapon is a family heirloom,[N]

OUTRO TEXT

Simon
That seems to have been their leader.
Vivian
Yeah, it's always the talkative ones.
S
You holding up alright?
Viv
To an extent. I knew what I was in for when I joined.
ML
Can we get moving now?
Viv
Oh yes, of course.
ML
Simon?
S
Yes, onwards. We'll move to Tryza. That should be west enough. After that we'll move south as Demi instructed.
ML
Understood.
ML FADES OUT OF FRAME
Viv
...right.
S
Vivian, you've got some friends in Tryza, right?
Viv
Assuming they're... still around. I haven't managed to contact them. They used to live right outside the village.
S
Perfect. We'll try to take shelter there.
Viv
Simon, I don't know if they'll appreciate that.
S
We'll try at least.
SIMON FADES OUT OF FRAME
Viv
[eyesclose]Right...
