Long flashback serving as exposition. Simon asks Vivian what she knows about the catalysts. He tells her that unlike what everybody believes, catalysts can be destroyed now. It takes but a drop from the height of half an adult human to destroy them at this point.

That's when Vivian wakes up and realizes what's been bothering her. (Why didn't Simon just destroy the catalyst?) We hide this realization from the audience, although it's a pretty straightforward realization to come to.
