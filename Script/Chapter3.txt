Long flashback serving as exposition. Simon asks Vivian & new character Linda what they know about the catalysts. People aren't happy as catalysts should be fragile enough to be destroyed by simply dropping from a small elevation, yet none of the leaders are willing to destroy them. Some unhappy people have formed a terrorist group DetheCa, Destroy the Catalysts, which aims to destroy the catalysts by means of violence.

That's when Vivian wakes up and realizes what's been bothering her. (Why didn't Simon just destroy the catalyst?) We hide this realization from the audience, although it's a pretty straightforward realization to come to.

Shaman: Linda
Cleric: Carmen

*flashback*
*Knock*
S
Come in.
L
You called for us?
S
Ah, Vivian, Linda, glad you could come.
V
Are we in trouble, professor?
S
Nothing of the sort, and Simon is fine. There's something I would like to ask you.
L
Shoot.
S
What can you tell me about the cataclysts?
V
... We're in trouble after all, aren't we?
S
Oh, not at all. Feel free to speak your mind.
L
They're large scale bio-weapons. Their main purpose is to make citizens too scared of their life to think of rebelling against the crown.
V
Linda!
L
The man wants my honest thoughts? He can have them.
V
For the record, these are her words, not mine.
S
You see things differently to Linda then?
V
Of course! We need our catalyst to deter Coramo or Beria from invading us, or worse, use their catalyst against us.
S
Shame, I happen to see things the same way as Linda.
L
Wha-
V
You do?
S
At their core, catalysts are used to change the weather of a desired geographical location. With a blast radius the size of a country, this results in precipitation of Fowler particles. These turn gaseous upon contact with the earth. When humans inhale enough of these, they either die, metamorphosize or both. A modern harness can be used to target any place on the planet. Maybe bio-weapon would be a misnomer, but the danger of catalysts can not be overstated.
L
And what's your view on the deterrent theory?
S
Ultimately, I can see the logic. Each country owns one catalyst. Say Beria uses theirs to attack Arzil. Beria no longer has a catalyst. Arzil's out. Coramo would then use their catalyst to destroy Beria, and effectively conquer the world. Whichever country strikes first is sure to lose. However there's been three criticisms leveraged against this viewpoint.
V
Other than the assumption people will commit genocide to ensure world domination?
L
Given the opportunity, that's exactly what those in charge would do. If they had even a shred of humanity, they'd have destroyed their catalysts.
S
Exactly. If one of the three monarchs destroyed their catalyst, they would not be targeted by either of the others. The other monarchs would instead try to pre-empt one another.
L
The only reason why none of them have destroyed their catalyst is because they still believe in the deterrent theory. They're waiting for someone to mess up, giving them a chance at world domination. Nevermind the fact it'll involve two countries' populations getting wiped out.
S
Going back to the three issues with the deterrent theory. First of all, it's optimistic; It relies on those in charge of the catalysts to put protecting their citizens over personal vendettas. A single moment of emotion is all it takes to fire off a catalyst. The second problem lies with the Alchemist's Poem. Do you remember how it goes?
L
It's only the most popular nursery rhyme on all three islands.
S
...
V
Do I have to recite the whole thing?
S
...
L
...
V
...
``There once lived an alchemist without peer,
fatigued by human nature and its veneer.
Crafting six catalysts to peel away
the facade that people obey.
One for each land;
Three kept on hand.
A single one calls forth a violet deluge,
across a kingdom, leaving no refuge.
All it's denizens doomed to transition
into beasts incapable of deception.
The alchemist, departing the mortal plane,
leaves five catalysts to remain.''
S
The last verse sums it up nicely; There are five catalysts.
V
So I didn't need to recite the whole thing. I didn't even need to recite anything; We all know how the poem goes. Who exactly did I do this for?
S
My ears. They like your voice.
V
[thought]Maybe your face will like my fist.[\thought]
S
If any country gets their hands on a second catalyst they can use both to wipe out the other two countries.
L
Weren't the lost catalysts destroyed?
S
They were never found. It's possible one or both may still be intact. There are two ways of confirming it though. One is by simply finding them. This option is out if they're destroyed. The second option has been an oddly well-kept secret, considering how much information regarding catalysts is common knowledge. Catalysts constantly emit a specific long-range radiowave unique to them. They can also be used to transceive this radiowave. Installing a catalyst into a harness will reveal how many active catalysts exist in this world.
V
You're saying the monarchs know exactly how many catalysts still exist? Why didn't any of them pick up a lost one, and wipe out the other nations?
S
Conveniently, the catalysts can't locate other catalysts. They can only confirm their existence.
L
How do you know this, and why are you telling us?
S
I know this, because the court trusts me. This is also why I know that the two lost catalysts have not been destroyed. Documents can be leaked, so Arzil relies on oral tradition to keep this info in their circle. My guess is that Beria and Coramo have similar systems in place.
L
And why are you telling us?
S
Because I trust you, and want you to trust me.
V
Becauuuuuse?
S
Because I'm planning to get my hands on Arzil's catalyst and destroy it.
V
What!?
S
Next, I'll get all the other catalysts and destroy them, one by one. We'll end the stalemate. No-one will have to worry about whether this will be the day they die anymore.
L
Now we're talking!
V
I'm out. No way am I risking my neck for this.
S
Vivian, I can't do this alone. We need more people for this.
L
We can end the stalemate. This is an opportunity to make a real difference!
V
It's an opportunity to have my head separated from my body. The stalemate has been around for centuries, yet no catalyst has been fired in all that time. This plan is bound to stir up the other countries. Who knows, maybe they'll get trigger-happy. I'm not committing treason for that. Have fun playing revolutionary, I'll be looking out for number one.
*flashback over*


*thinkbubble*
V
Why did I follow him on this trip? Why did I trust him? Why didn't I just report him back then? It would have been so much easier to just steer clear of all of this.
*\thinkbubble*
ML
Wake up, it's time to go.
V
I'm awake.
ML
Let's go then.
***
D
Brief summary before we move: we're currently in the Ivylands, closing in on Til forest. There are signs we're catching up with our target, Simon. He's likely moving carefully to avoid damaging the catalyst.
V
R-right...
ML
His *hypothetical* allies have yet to appear.
V
*thinkbubble*
Why are you looking at me when you say that?
*\thinkbubble*
D
We'll have to be cautious, yet swift.

*Camera pans south to Simon next to a fort.*

S
*Knock*
It's me. Open up.
A(lvin)
How'd it go?
S
I got *it*, however I'm still being tailed by my escorts.
A
Coramo?
S
No, Arzil. Coramo didn't manage to rout them and retreated.
A
How'd that happen? At best they'd wipe each other out.
S
Remember that girl I told you about? She's every bit a tactician as I expected her to be. Unfortunately so, as I couldn't recruit her.
A
You still want us to show her mercy?
S
No. Any moment she's able to guide her allies is a moment we're closer to losing everything. Seize the opportunity to [red]kill her[\red] as soon as it presents itself. She might not lead their group, but she's the only reason they present a threat to us.
A
Now, now, we'll take care of it. Just take a rest here, I'll tell you when we're done.
S
Alvin, I mean it. She knows exactly where to find openings in enemy formations. Don't underestimate her.
A
And we know these woods. Some of us have lived here for decades. We have prepared for this moment for at least just as long. We'll clean their clocks. Just rest and watch.
S
No, I'm going to keep moving to HQ. I trust your abilities, but worst-case you'll only delay them.
A
Suit yourself. I'll send a few people to escort you.
S
Thank you.
...
Alvin.
A
Yeah?
S
She's still naive. Make use of that.


*Alvin leaves fort*

A
ACTION STATIONS, EVERYONE. The enemy will be here any moment. Move to your positions. Send word to our forts.
L
General!
A
Linda. To your post.
L
What about the catalyst?
A
Handled.
L
Handled as in...?
A
As in don't worry your pretty little head about it. To your post!
L
Understood!

*Forces scramble*
*Linda approaches Vincent and Carmen*

C
Any idea what's going on?
L
Apparently the catalyst has been "handled".
V
What's that supposed to mean?
L
Alvin sent me off when I asked.
C
He's never been good at lying, you think Simon messed up?
L
I dunno, but I have a bad feeling about all of this. I need more intel, preferably from outside.
V
We're the only ones here not from Alvin's faction. We're as clueless as you. Who are you going to ask?
L
Not true; There's one more faction. Our enemies.
V
You're going to ask Arzil for intel? They'll sooner kill you.
L
I've got you two with me to prevent that from happening.
C
If Alvin heard you, he'd treat this as defection.
L
Then it's a good thing he's not nearby.
C
Say you somehow open a dialogue with Arzil, Say you trust the intel they give you, what will we do then?
L
If they corroborate my worst suspicions, I'll plead with them to let us join them.
V
Again, they'll just kill you.
C
No they won't. Linda can guide them to HQ.
V
They only need Linda for that.
L
Yes, but I won't help them if they hurt either of us.
C
Does that satisfy you?
V
...Fine.
L
Vincent, take Carmen with you and keep an eye on me from above. If I give the signal, land.

*Our heroes appear*

V
Why, I think Simon's not-so-hypothetical allies have appeared. Who could have thunk?
ML
...You vulpine-
D
Stop quibbling! Vivian, I expect you to command us on the field again.
V
Yes, Ma'am!
D
If we want to make up for the delay this battle will cause, we need to [red]obtain intel on the enemy.[red]
If we fail to, we won't catch up; [red]Game-over[red].


Vivian talks to Linda:

V
Linda, is that you!?
L
Vivian? What are *you* doing here?
V
Right back at you! You disappeared without a trace two years ago! Where have you been?
L
I joined the revolution. That's why I'm here. Why are you here?
V
Then you're aligned with Simon? He's currently carrying a catalyst. I don't know what he's planning, but it can't be good.
L
He's... carrying it?
V
Yes! That's the part that confused me. He's part of the revolutionists, right? Why didn't he destroy the catalyst?
L
You confirmed he's carrying it? Without a doubt?
V
He showed it to me. He killed his entourage just so he could escape with the catalyst. He wouldn't need to do that if he'd just destroyed it.
L
Oh no... I knew something was up, but this is far worse than I expected.
V
Does he have a harness? Is he planning on using the catalyst to confirm how many others exist?
L
Oh Vivian, it's much worse than that. We do have a harness, but we're already holding on to a catalyst for that purpose. There's absolutely no need for another. The only reason I could think of...
V
He's... He's going to fire it, isn't he?
L
What in the world is he thinking? How could...
Right, no time for this. *whistle*
*Vincent & Carmen appear*
Vin
You called?
L
Vincent, Carmen. Simon is carrying the catalyst.
Vin
I knew it!
C
No you didn't.
L
Defection time. This here is Vivian. We'll be joining up with her now.
V
I don't know if...
L
You're leading this group right? Let us join. I know where the revolutionists' base is. I can lead you through the passage Simon is taking.
V
Err, alright. I'm sure Demi won't mind the help. ML's going to be furious again, I'm sure.
C
We'll have to [red]seize the gate[\red] to the passage. Alvin should be guarding it right now.
Vin
Leave him to me. Never liked that guy.
V
If you're joining us, then you'll follow my instructions.
L
Vincent.
Vin
...Fine.
V
Thank you! We can use all the help we can get.
C
This mess is partially our mistake. We'll be glad to correct it.


*Seize without talking to Linda*
V
I guess I'll just take control of this. There has to be something here, considering how well it was guarded.
***
D
The enemy retreated. Did you do something?
V
I took control of this gate. I'm not sure where it leads, but it the enemy commander was in charge of guarding it.
ML
You... took control of it?
V
Yep.
ML
Without any intel, you decided to seize the gate?
V
It felt intuitive.
ML
...
***
L
Excuse me.
D
Who are you? Hands in the air!
V
Linda!?
L
Vivian!
V
Demi, it's alright, she's a friend. What are you doing here?
L
I joined the revolution.
V
Then you're aligned with Simon? He's currently carrying a catalyst. I don't know what he's planning, but it can't be good.
L
He's... carrying it?
V
Yes! That's the part that confused me. He's part of the revolutionists, right? Why didn't he destroy the catalyst?
L

Oh Vivian, it's much worse than that. We do have a harness, but we're already holding on to a catalyst for that purpose. There's absolutely no need for another. The only reason I could think of...
ML
He's going to fire it.
L
What in the world is he thinking? How could...
Right, no time for this. *whistle*
*Vincent & Carmen appear*
Vin
You called?
L
Vincent, Carmen. Simon is carrying the catalyst.
Vin
I knew it!
C
No you didn't.
L
Defection time. This here is Vivian. We'll be joining up with her now.
V
I don't know if...
L
You're leading this group right? Let us join. I know where the revolutionists' base is. I can lead you through the passage Simon is taking.
V
Demi?
D
You're a revolutionist? We represent Arzil. Are you sure you want to work together? If your friends attack us, we will fight back with lethal force.
L
I'm not affiliating myself with the revolution anymore. I wasn't aware they were going to fire catalysts.
D
Alright then, lead the way.


*Seize after talking to Linda*
ML
The gate's been seized, now what?
V
Demi, ML, there's someone I need you to meet.
L
Hello.
V
This is Linda, she's an old classmate. We both used to study under Simon.
ML
Did I not see her among the enemies we were just fighting?
L
They were revolutionists! You wouldn't be fighting them in the first place if you had treated your subjects as people!
ML
Terrorists more like. Your fellow `revolutionist' is carrying a catalyst!
L
I don't have to hear that from you! Arzil's been flaunting their catalyst for centuries!
D
Vivian, why did you introduce her to us?
V
Right! Linda, don't argue with ML. You'll be here all night.
L
I would like...
I would like to join you.
ML
Oh that's rich. Abandoning the revolution so soon?
L
I didn't abandon it. My allies did. We were not supposed to be collecting catalysts. We were supposed to destroy them. Including the one that is kept at headquarters, we have two catalysts.
D
Simon already owned the other lost catalyst?
L
Yes, he didn't fire it under pretense of using it to keep tabs on the other catalysts.
ML
How does that work?
D
A harness can be used to detect catalysts, if a catalyst is slotted.
ML
That's the first I'm hearing of this!
D
It's highly classified info. I guess Simon saw that differently, considering his subordinates know.
V
He's got two catalysts. He'll only need one to detect other catalysts. We don't know what he's going to do with the other.
L
Hence my defection. I'll show you the way through this passage commander Alvin was guarding. Please let me help.
D
We were killing your comrades just before. Can we still work together?
L
Although I don't like it, I understand why you were doing it. Besides, there's a much bigger problem that needs solving.
D
Alright then, lead the way.
