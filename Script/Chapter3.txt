Long flashback serving as exposition. Simon asks Vivian & new character Linda what they know about the catalysts. People aren't happy as catalysts should be fragile enough to be destroyed by simply dropping from a small elevation, yet none of the leaders are willing to destroy them. Some unhappy people have formed a terrorist group DetheCa, Destroy the Catalysts, which aims to destroy the catalysts by means of violence.

That's when Vivian wakes up and realizes what's been bothering her. (Why didn't Simon just destroy the catalyst?) We hide this realization from the audience, although it's a pretty straightforward realization to come to.

Shaman: Linda
Cleric: Carmen
Wyvern Knight: Vincent

General2: Taylor


*flashback*
*Knock*
S
Come in.
L
You called for us?
S
Ah, Vivian, Linda, glad you could come.
V
Are we in trouble, professor?
S
Nothing of the sort, and Simon is fine. There's something I would like to ask you.
L
Shoot.
S
What can you tell me about the cataclysts?
V
... We're in trouble after all, aren't we?
S
Oh, not at all. Feel free to speak your mind.
L
They're large scale bio-weapons. There's but one reason why they're still around: To make citizens too scared of their life to think of rebelling against the crown.
V
Linda!
L
No, I'm done playing goody two-shoes. The man wants my honest thoughts? He can have them.
V
For the record, these are her words, not mine.
S
You see things differently to Linda then?
V
Of course! We need our catalyst to deter Coramo or Beria from invading us, or worse, use their catalyst against us.
S
Shame, I happen to see things the same way as Linda.
L
Wha-
V
You... do?
S
At their core, catalysts are used to change the weather of a desired geographical location. With a blast radius the size of a country, this results in precipitation of Fowler particles. These turn gaseous upon contact with the earth. When humans inhale enough of these, they either die, metamorphosize or both. A modern harness can be used to target any place on the planet. Maybe bio-weapon would be a misnomer, but the danger of catalysts can not be overstated.
L
And what's your view on the deterrent theory?
S
Ultimately, I can see the logic. Each country owns one catalyst. Say Beria uses theirs to attack Arzil. Beria no longer has a catalyst. Arzil's out. Coramo would then use their catalyst to destroy Beria, and effectively conquer the world. Whichever country strikes first is sure to lose. However there's been three criticisms leveraged against this viewpoint.
V
Other than the assumption people will commit genocide to ensure world domination?
L
Given the opportunity, that's exactly what those in charge would do. If they had even a shred of humanity, they'd have destroyed their catalysts.
S
Exactly. If one of the three monarchs destroyed their catalyst, they would not be targeted by either of the others. The other monarchs would instead try to pre-empt one another instead.
L
The only reason why none of them have destroyed their catalyst is because they still believe in the deterrent theory and are hoping for their chance at world domination. Nevermind the fact it'll involve two countries' populations getting wiped out.
S
Going back to the three issues with the deterrent theory. First of all, it's optimistic; It relies on those in charge of the catalysts to put protecting their citizens over personal vendettas. A single moment of emotion is all it takes to fire off a catalyst. The second problem lies with the Alchemist's Poem. Do you remember how it goes?
L
It's only the most popular nursery rhyme on all three islands.
S
...
V
Do I have to recite the whole thing?
S
...
L
...
V
...
``There once lived an alchemist without peer,
fatigued by human nature and its veneer.
Crafting six catalysts to peel away
the facade that people obey.
One for each land;
Three kept on hand.
A single one calls forth a violet deluge,
across a kingdom, leaving no refuge.
All it's denizens doomed to transition
into beasts incapable of deception.
The alchemist, departing the mortal plane,
leaves five catalysts to remain.''
S
The last verse sums it up nicely; There are five catalysts.
V
So I didn't need to recite the whole thing. I didn't even need to recite anything; We all know how the poem goes. Who exactly did I do this for?
S
My ears. They like your voice.
V
[thought]Maybe your face will like my fist.[\thought]
S
If any country gets their hands on a second catalyst they can use both to wipe out the other two countries.
L
Weren't the lost catalysts destroyed?
S
They were never found. It's possible one or both may still be intact. There are two ways of confirming it though. One is by finding them. This option is out if they're destroyed. The second option has been an oddly well-kept secret, considering how much information regarding catalysts is common knowledge. Catalysts constantly emit a specific long-range radiowave unique to them. Installing a catalyst into a harness will reveal how many active catalysts exist in this world.
V
You're saying the monarchs know exactly how many catalysts still exist? Why didn't any of them pick up a lost one, and wipe out the other nations?
S
Conveniently, the catalysts can't locate other catalysts. They can only confirm their existence.
L
How do you know this, and why are you telling us?
S
I know this, because the court trusts me. This is also why I know that the two lost catalysts have not been destroyed. Documents can be leaked, so Arzil relies on oral tradition to keep this info in their circle. My guess is that Beria and Coramo have similar systems in place.
L
And why are you telling us?
S
Because I trust you, and want you to trust me.
V
Becauuuuuse?
S
Because I'm planning to get my hands on Arzil's catalyst and destroy it.
V
What!?
S
Next, I'll get all the other catalysts and destroy them, one by one. We'll end the stalemate. No-one will have to worry about whether this will be the day they die anymore.
L
Now we're talking!
V
I'm out. No way am I risking my neck for this.
S
Vivian, I can't do this alone. We need more people for this.
L
We can end the stalemate. This is an opportunity to make a real difference!
V
It's an opportunity to have my head separated from my body. The stalemate has been around for centuries, yet no catalyst has been fired in all that time. This plan is bound to stir up the other countries. Who knows, maybe they'll get trigger-happy. I'm not committing treason for that. Have fun playing revolutionary, I'll be looking out for number one.
*flashback over*


*thinkbubble*
V
Why did I follow him on this trip? Why did I trust him? Why didn't I just report him back then? It would have been so much easier to just steer clear of all of this.
*\thinkbubble*
ML
Wake up, it's time to go.
V
I'm awake.
ML
Let's go then.
***
D
Brief summary before we move: we're currently in the Ivylands, closing in on Til forest. There are signs we're catching up with our target, Simon. He's likely moving carefully to avoid damaging the catalyst.
V
R-right...
ML
His *hypothetical* allies have yet to appear.
V
*thinkbubble*
Why are you looking at me when you say that?
*\thinkbubble*
D
We'll have to be cautious, yet swift.

*Camera pans south to Simon next to a fort.*

S
*Knock*
It's me. Open up.
A(lvin)
How'd it go?
S
I got *it*, however I'm still being tailed by my escorts.
A
Coramo?
S
No, Arzil. Coramo didn't manage to rout them and retreated.
A
How'd that happen? At best they'd wipe each other out.
S
Remember that girl I told you about? She's every bit a tactician as I expected her to be. Unfortunately so, as I couldn't recruit her.
A
You still want us to show her mercy?
S
No. Any moment she's able to guide her allies is a moment we're closer to losing everything. Seize the opportunity to kill her as soon as it presents itself. She might not lead their group, but she's the only reason they present a threat to us.
A
Now, now, we'll take care of it. Just take a rest here, I'll tell you when we're done.
S
Alvin, I mean it. She knows exactly where to find openings in enemy formations. Don't underestimate her.
A
And we know these woods. Some of us have lived here for decades. We have prepared for this moment for at least just as long. We'll clean their clocks. Just rest and watch.
S
No, I'm going to keep moving to HQ. I trust your abilities, but worst-case you'll only delay them.
A
Suit yourself. I'll send a few people to escort you.
S
Thank you.

*Alvin leaves fort*

A
ACTION STATIONS, EVERYONE. The enemy will be here any moment. Move to your positions.
L
General!
A
Linda. To your post.
L
What about the catalyst?
A
Handled.
L
Handled as in...?
A
As in don't worry your pretty little head about it. To your post!
L
Understood!

*Forces scramble*
*Linda approaches Vincent and Carmen*

C
Any idea what's going on?
L
Apparently the catalyst has been "handled".
V
What's that supposed to mean?
L
Alvin sent me off when I asked.
C
He's never been good at lying, you think Simon messed up?
L
I dunno, but I have a bad feeling about all of this. I need more intel, preferably from outside.
V
We're the only ones here not from Alvin's faction. We're as clueless as you. Who are you going to ask?
L
Not true; There's one more faction. Our enemies.
V
You're going to ask Arzil for intel? They'll sooner kill you.
L
I've got you two with me to prevent that from happening.
C
If Alvin heard you he'd treat this as defection.
L
Then it's a good thing he's not around.
C
Say you somehow open a dialogue with Arzil, Say you trust the intel they give you, what will we do then?
L
If they corroborate my worst suspicions, I'll plead with them to let us join them.
V
Again, they'll just kill you.
C
No they won't. We can guide them to HQ.
V
They only need one of us for that.
L
Yes, but none of us will help them if they hurt any of us.
C
Does that satisfy you?
V
...Fine.

*Our heroes appear*

V
Why, I think Simon's not-so-hypothetical allies have appeared. Who could have thunk?
ML
...You vulpine-
D
Stop quibbling! Vivian, I expect you to command us on the field again.
V
Yes, Ma'am!
D
If we want to make up for the delay this battle will cause, we need to somehow [red]obtain intel on the enemy.[red]
If we fail to, we won't catch up; [red]Game-over[red].
