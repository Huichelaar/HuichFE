SIMON BACKSTORY STUFF
What if Simon were part of Arzil royal family, and/or used to serve as an advisor? Went mad over the constant threat the ruling party would use the catalyst on an enemy nation "Because they felt like it", and tried to destroy the catalyst? With two catalysts in the hands of the other countries, they'd use it on each other to prevent becoming a target themselves, further reducing the number of catalysts out there.

Maybe Simon had to keep his royal heritage secret as a sentence for trying to destroy the Arzil catalyst? Would he not need to be punished more? Why'd he get to be an archaeologist sent to investigate something that will likely hold a catalyst? Maybe he's incognito, and the family doesn't know he's the exiled royal?

Maybe these details could be revealed in a support. On the other hand, the story could use more details in later chapters which still don't house much story stuff.

"Hauptsache, this fear [of catalysts] is going to end". Let Simon throw in bits of different languages every now & then. Like "On y va!" in Ch2.


WHY DID ARZIL LET VIVIAN JOIN THE EXCAVATION?
Maybe a support convo between Vivian and Demi could deal with this question.

Milo/Leona & Herbert Support.
Find a moment where ML gets pissed off at Vivian, jokes they'll do something bad to her, giving Herbert the chance to quip "Get in line, buddy".

Maybe make part of their support be their mutual dislike of Vivian.
