OSIAN WILL BE A RETREAT-INSTEAD-OF-DIE UNIT

Viv
Osian, you know about the phantoms?
O
Yes, we've been informed already.
Viv
And you know about the rumour that they're reincarnated dead people?
O
Yes, that part too, although I don't find that likely.
Viv
No?
O
No. It's too far out there.
Viv
Well that could've been said about many things that exist today.
O


Of course. However, necromancy has
something that sets it apart.
There are few topics as widely researched. Even fewer that have been researched for as long. Yet, there's been no known progress at all. Eventually people had settled for second-best.
Viv
Second-best to bringing people back?
O
I'm referring to preventing death.
Changing our diet, disinfecting
wounds, applying salves, etc.
We wouldn't have vulneraries if we
were still figuring out immortality.














Of course. However, there's something
different about necromancy.
It's a topic that has a most ancient
background.[A] Not many problems have
been as researched as necromancy.
