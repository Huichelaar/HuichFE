Some notes:
Multisample AFAF24 & AFAFE4 use the same note charts & samples, but different envelopes for their samples.
Multisample AFAE34 & AFB11C & AFB194 also do this.

AFAD50 & AFB02C each use 3 samples. Samples 1 & 2 are the same. Sample 5 differs. They use the same note charts. SC 9FC12C uses two samples which are (seemingly lower quality) variations of Samples 1 & 2. SC 9FC12C also uses a different note chart.

AFB080, AFB0A4 & AFB1F4 use the same 2 samples.

song 27 and song 33 in Sacred Cards use different multisample tables for instrument 89, but the same samples and note charts. Envelopes differ. This happens to other instruments too. Not going to bother creating separate soundfonts.

SC instrument 90 uses different and fewer samples to Reshef 105, but it's close enough IMO.

Reshef soundbank 40 just holds voicelines & some wave memories. 39 may be for environmental sounds.

We're using Reshef's drumtable for SC. Hopefully it'll work.
