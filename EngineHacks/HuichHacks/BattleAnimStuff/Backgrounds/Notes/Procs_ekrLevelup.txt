Proc at 0x75932C

80739E1     Makes "Level Up" text appear.
8073A4D     Does a lot of stuff to set up statpanel. More details in separate .txt file. Runs once.
YIELD
8073CE9     Display_level_up_screen. Prepare statpanel Gfx. Also puts mapanim "Level Up" text in OBJ.
            Prepares char's face. Clear BG2 mapbuffer. Calls HUGE Determining_level-up_status function. Which
            seems to prepare BG2's text. Runs once.

8073E19     Sets the scrolling HBlankHandler (8074835). Enable sync BG0, 1, 2, palette. Runs once.
8073E49     Waits for timer > 50 (which it will be on first call). Resets timer and sets some other vars
            (0x2Ch, 0x44w 0x48w, 0x4Cw, 0x50w) Copies entire palette buffer to 0x20165C8. Ends loop.

8073E8D     Uses vars for easing function calls. Copies palette buffer buffer to palette buffer, then applies
            fading to select palettes. Reset timer and break loop after 0x14 iterations. During this loop, panel and face scroll in.

8073FB5     Initializes stat up efx procs for stats that change.

SLEEP 0x14

These procs use 0x2A. If 0x2A is set, flip the title card instead of changing level.
  8073FE1     Does something if 0x2Ab is set. Either way, runs once.
  8074041     Also does something if 0x2Ab is set. Either way, runs once.
  80740C9     As above.
  807401D     0x2Ab isn't set: Reset timer, Display sparkle anim for lvl (0x74D58), Change text, play sound.
              0x2Ab is set: Delete some 6C and do some other stuff, Reset timer.
              Either way, runs once.
  807419D     ends if 0x2Ab is set. Otherwise, increment timer. If timer is >0x1D wait. Timer should start at 0 
              though...

80741CD     EndLevelUpGrowthStatusAnimation. Display sparkle anim for each stat up per every 0x14 frames. 8 
            possible stat ups.

80742BD     Wait for 0x6D frames. Reset timer, Delete some proc. Sets the scrolling HBlankHandler (8074835) 
            again. Probably used to scroll out the panel and face. End loop.
80742ED     End loop. Basically YIELD.
80742F9     Basically 8073E8D but in reverse. Ends after only 0x8 iterations though.

80743C1     Does a lot of stuff. Seems to be setting screen blocks, screen sizes, BGPositions, BGPriorities, AIS 
            priorities back. Redraws plateaus. Also deletes face.

8074545     Deletes some procs, changes some vars in AISrelated procs (just like 8073A4D). Call 
            ResumeEfxWeaponIcon. Set 0x29 var, which is read by a different proc. This proc ends
            Procs_ekrLevelup as a result.
