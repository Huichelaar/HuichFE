TODO

From IntroCutscene/README.txt:
The textsprites for the monologue were made in MSpaint textboxes. IIRC, I selected Monotype Corsiva as 
font and chose size 10, whilst making sure the letter colour is white, and the background is black. Next, 
I put the image of text in Aseprite and reduced their saturation to 0 to get an entirely black & white 
text. Finally, saved it as png, opened it in Usenti to ensure the colours' RGB values are in GBA ranges, 
and saved again.

This time I just pasted the text in usenti with only a monochrome 16-colour palette set, which forced the text to 
be in that palette.
