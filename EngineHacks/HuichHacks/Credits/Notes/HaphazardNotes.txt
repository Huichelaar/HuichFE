Procs_opinfoenter,
  +0x2E byte,           String length.
  +0x2C short,          Max-len minus string length.

  Procs_opinfoview
    +0x2A short,        Init to 0. Timer.
    +0x2C byte,         Parent sets this on init. Seems to indicate index of character in name to be drawn.
    +0x2E short,        Max-len minus string length + (+0x2C*0xC), determines letter's X.
    
    Loop routine1:
      Seems to set OAMRotScale matrixes. Increases +0x2A by 0x10 every iteration until equal to 0x100: Reset +0x2A and end loop.
    Loop routine2:
      Seems to just draw the characters.
    Loop routine3:
      Seems to set OAMRotScale matrixes for removing the characters.
      
    0x80B2A14 first RegisterObject call is for when letter rotscale, second for when they don't.

      r2:       Y
      r3:       width
