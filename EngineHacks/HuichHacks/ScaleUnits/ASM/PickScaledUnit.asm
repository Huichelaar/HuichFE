@ Hooked at 0xF714. Picks the UNIT command
@ which fits the absolute level.
@ Pick UNIT:
@   +0      if absolute level <= SCU_T1UnitMaxLv,
@   +0x14   if SCU_T1UnitMaxLv < absolute level <= SCU_T2UnitMaxLv,
@   +0x28   otherwise.
@ Regs:
@   r0-r3: Idc. They will be overwritten when we return.
@   r6: pointer to where UNIT command is buffered.
@ Returns:
@   Nothing, but changes the pointer in r6 to reflect
@   the UNIT that should be loaded.
