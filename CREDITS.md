These credits were probably written by Nintenlord. Credits to
  - Nintenlord for making this.
  - Kate/Klo/whatever for writing FE6 CHAR support
  - Everyone who submitted event codes for this, especially
    Fire Blazer and flyingace24.
  - markyjoe1990 for FE7 event template.
  - Mariobro3828 for FE7 world map definition values and
    for making the EAstdlib Macro and Command List.txt.
  - Arch for making code I can use to debug this app, 
    for his tutorials and his FE6 template.
  - Ryrumeli for telling me the ASM routine that handles
    the events in FE8.
  - Omni for reporting errors with FE6 disassembly script.
  - Camtech075/Cam/Kam for making FE8 template.
  - Everyone who uses this and/or reports bugs and/or gives
    feedback.
    
With additional credits to:
  - Vennobennu/Venno, for identifying many FE8 codes, and
    making many of the codes that deal with the world map.
  - Gryz, for aiding a ton in all the AI research done on
    FE7, which was a boon in developing the new AI model.
  - Circleseverywhere, for inspiring some of the design
    decisions in revamping EA. Also checking my work, and
    making several macros.
  - Camdar/CT075 and Zahlman, for inspiring a UNIX-like
    design for #incext.
