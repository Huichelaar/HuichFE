Improved/Smoothed Axe by BwdYeti.

Scripting by Shadowofchaos.

Red Variant by Red. This version causes the axe to arc backward in a swing.

Huichelaar repaletted the Red Variant and the vanilla handaxe and unarmed animations.

Aside from folders marked with "Repal", these animations are designed to work, palette-wise, with the Vanilla Berserker's Handaxe and Unarmed frames.
