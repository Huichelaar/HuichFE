Hey, Zora here!

Might start making these more for my tilesets honestly.

Should be backwards compatible 90% with previous maps.

What's different in this version is the addition of Barrels, shadows for bridge tiles, rope (all 3 of which work in tandem to create ports), along with better shading on the fence tiles AND tall walls for them.

They aren't perfect - nothing I make is - but they should be good enough.

Especially considering everything else this tileset can do already, missing a few pieces is juuuuuuuuuuuust fine.
