Search & Clear all TODO&FIXME.

comment out DEBUG define in ROM Buildfile

Remove commented out proc calls & includes & unused definitions in any definitions.asm

Project, remove unused item icons, also clear duplicates.

Test if retreat also awards materials!

TODO, remove Simon's Stubborn Cynic ability, and just make him lv14?

If there's space left, leave chapter & game intro graphics uncompressed for faster load (on hardware).

Don't forget slim lance needs an upgrade to something with Shade or Shade+

Make sure to write supports.

Add SummonASM once you've got playable summoners. https://feuniverse.us/t/snakes-pit-of-asm-and-other-stuff/3627/45
Add Support rework rework & base convo's. https://feuniverse.us/t/snakes-pit-of-asm-and-other-stuff/3627/81

Status Screen, change Personal Data, weapons & supports, etc. headers. Actually, statscreen is ugly. Idk what to do about this.

TODO write proper guide entries for materials, fortresses, class level caps. Also change existing guide entries to reflect changes you made.

If you give units the Slayer skill, check out the README in SkillSystem/Skills/EffectivenessSkills/Nullify/. Need to take extra steps. Item effectiveness is also altered by this hack, so add an entry to EffectivenessRework.event.

Fort affinity matchups idea: Joker affinity that always gives +2 bonus? Affinity that at best gives +1 bonus?

If there's space left and the original BGs are lengthy enough: Replace BattleBGs with uncompressed longer panoramas for siege tome anims.

Config contains toggles of stuff I'm not sure I want to disable or enable. Once hack finished, remove these toggles.

If we don't redo ChapterIntro: bring relief palette & gem count to chapter csv. Otherwise:
Redo ChapterIntro, let's try a perspective view using BG scaling on HBlank. (Uncompressed map sprites?)
Make retreated units not appear in chapterintro.
  - ChapterIntro song doesn't loop correctly. Try using what song 0x314 uses when chapter title appears.
  - ChapterIntro, DrawUnitCheck, check for Ephraim-disappear instead?

Toward the end. Remove text entries of features you didn't include.

7743 wrote this. Maybe we can find a use for it?
ldr r0, =0x03006650    @gMusicPlayerInfo1    {U}
ldr r1, #200        @Percent of speed. 100 is normal. Double speed at 200.
blh 080D117C        @m4aMPlayTempoControl    {U}

Generic'ize CRE_waitForChildren to just waitForChildren.

Darken screen for long-range attacks.

What if we make a proc that refreshes/loops some colours in a palette and create a battleanim command that we insert in the standing motions mode? Pay attention to when the palette is set to all-white during hit-frames (maybe hook in the attack-hit command or whatever changes the palette to white?).

Ask people who completed ch2 ||when (if at all) they noticed the tile Simon can use to escape||.

Set REDA speeds to 0 or 1

Add skillprocdisplay stuff.

Remove Raid config define.

Create some button to load backup save in battle menu?

Seems like credits still get stuck at portraits sometimes. Need to find out how to reproduce this.

credits: WyvKnight battle anim doesn't slide far back enough. Wyvern's snout is still visible. Increase how far battle anims slide to the right.

If we need space:
  - Room for 0x2000 text entries. Can reduce this in repointedTextTable.event.
  - Some tables have entries they're not using, see Tables/TableOptions.s.

PLAN, Meals. Can feed any unit one or zero meals in prep screen. Costs food-materials. Can feed multiple units, but each only gets one meal at most. Idea is, the larger your army, the more materials you could spend on food. Maybe also let recipes be optional objectives in chapters to unlock meals? Re-use support bits to indicate which meal a unit has eaten (5 bits for 31 possible meals?) or use unused debufftable bits. Check which things check debufftable to implement buffs & debuffs. Maybe increase buffs if unit affinity matches with meal? Make certain effects overlap with fort abilities and skills for maximum optimization fun. Meal ideas:
  - +1 Str.
  - +1 Mag.
  - +1 Res.
  - +1 Def.
  - +1 Skl.
  - +1 Spd.
  - +1 Luk.
  - +1 Con.
  - +1 Mov, +1 Spd, -2 Str, -2 Mag.
  - +2 Str, -1 Spd.
  - +2 Mag, -1 Spd.
  - Meals that have effects which overlap with fortmaster abilities & skills.
  - +1 weapon exp.

PLAN, Need enough fortmaster abilities for at least 35 people (22 forts + 20 units = 42 playable units).
23 abilities (including duplicates) lined out here atm (12 more to go!). Fort abilities do stack.
  - 2x Exp boost. Unlock first exp boost unit early on, second exp boost unit lateishgame.
  - 1x Str boost. +1 for tier 1-2, +2 for tier 3-5, +3 for tier 6.
  - 1x Mag boost.
  - 1x Def boost.
  - 1x Res boost.
  - 1x Skl boost.
  - 1x Spd boost.
  - 1x Luk boost.
  - 1x Con boost.
  - 1x Produce boost. Increases how many materials every fort produces after chapter completion. Unlock lateishgame.
  - 1x Miracle. Per chapter, one 15% chance for an ally to survive a lethal attack if HP > 1. SkillSys Miracle doesn't work. Make a new proc-skill and make skilltester check forts for a fortmaster with this ability. Tiers:
    - 2: one 20% chance.
    - 3: two 20% chances.
    - 4: two 25% chances.
    - 5: three 25% chances.
    - 6: three 30% chances.
  - 2x Backup boost. Increase the amount of times you can return to a backup. Tiers:
    - 1-2: +1.
    - 3-5: +2.
    - 6: +3.
  - 1x Armsthrift. Percentage chance of any allied unit to not consume a weapon use. Tiers:
    - 1: 5%.
    - 2: 10%.
      ...
    - 6: 30%.
  - 1x AltArmsthrift. The first X allied weapon uses in a chapter won't be consumed. X = Tier * 2. If Armsthrift and AltArmsthrift are active: Roll once for Armsthrift, if negative, consume AltArmsthrift charge if any are left. If positive, don't consume AltArmsthrift charge.
  - 2x Despoil. X% chance to receive Y gold when an allied unit defeats an enemy. Tiers:
    - 1: X = 2%, Y = 50.
    - 2: X = 2%, Y = 100.
    - 3: X = 5%, Y = 100.
    - 4: X = 5%, Y = 250.
    - 5: X = 10%, Y = 250.
    - 6: X = 10%, Y = 500.
  - 1x Cheaper armories/vendors/secretshops. ONLY during chapters, not on the WM! (Do skirmishes have functional shops?) Discount 5% per tier, up to 30%.
  - 1x Renewal. Among allied units that don't have full HP, X will be randomly chosen and Y% of their max HP will be added to their current HP at the start of player phase. Tiers:
    - 1-2: X = 1, Y = 10%.
    - 3-4: X = 1, Y = 20%.
    - 5: X = 2, Y = 20%.
    - 6: X = 3, Y = 20%.
  - 2x Staff Savant. Increase staff range by X. Tiers:
    - 1-2: X = 1.
    - 3-5: X = 2.
    - 6: X = 3.
  - 1x ProcSkill activation rate up by X (flat increase). Tiers:
    - 1: X = 5.
    - 2: X = 10.
    ...
    - 6: X = 30.
  - Crit, Hit, Ddg, Avo increase?
    

PLAN, Crafting should allow:
  - fusing two of the same items (total durability no higher than 63?), no material cost. (seems Tequila has a "Convoy Combine" patch which already does this)
  - repairing an item, costs up to 5 different types of materials. Reserve three dec digits for each material (10 bits)
  - upgrading an item. Same idea for costs as above.
