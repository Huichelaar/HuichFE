Search & Clear all TODO&FIXME.

comment out DEBUG define in ROM Buildfile

Remove commented out proc calls & includes & unused definitions in any definitions.asm

Project, remove unused item icons, also clear duplicates.

Test if retreat also awards materials!

TODO, remove Simon's Stubborn Cynic ability, and just make him lv14?

If there's space left, leave chapter & game intro graphics uncompressed for faster load (on hardware).

Don't forget slim lance needs an upgrade to something with Shade or Shade+

Make sure to write supports.

Country names: Arzil, Beria, Coramo

Status Screen, change Personal Data, weapons & supports, etc. headers

TODO write proper guide entries for materials, fortresses, class level caps. Also change existing guide entries to reflect changes you made.

If you give units the Slayer skill, check out the README in SkillSystem/Skills/EffectivenessSkills/Nullify/. Need to take extra steps. Item effectiveness is also altered by this hack, so add an entry to EffectivenessRework.event.

Fort affinity matchups idea: Joker affinity that always gives +2 bonus? Affinity that at best gives +1 bonus?

If there's space left and the original BGs are lengthy enough: Replace BattleBGs with uncompressed longer panoramas for siege tome anims.

Define an item ID for Spirit Dust (Mag statbooster) in "Strmag/Str Mag Split/Installer.event". Energy Ring is used by default!
Item icon for Spirit Dust is included! Define your icon ID in "Strmag/_Master Asm Installer.event". Default is Green Note.

Config contains toggles of stuff I'm not sure I want to disable or enable. Once hack finished, remove these toggles.

If we don't redo ChapterIntro: bring relief palette & gem count to chapter csv. Otherwise:
Redo ChapterIntro, let's try a perspective view using BG scaling on HBlank. (Uncompressed map sprites?)
Make retreated units not appear in chapterintro.
  - ChapterIntro song doesn't loop correctly. Try using what song 0x314 uses when chapter title appears.
  - ChapterIntro, DrawUnitCheck, check for Ephraim-disappear instead?

Toward the end. Remove text entries of features you didn't include.

Generic'ize CRE_waitForChildren to just waitForChildren.

Darken screen for long-range attacks.

What if we make a proc that refreshes/loops some colours in a palette and create a battleanim command that we insert in the standing motions mode? Pay attention to when the palette is set to all-white during hit-frames (maybe hook in the attack-hit command or whatever changes the palette to white?).

Ask people who completed ch2 ||when (if at all) they noticed the tile Simon can use to escape||.

Set class level-up skills for cavalier, warrior & others!

Add skillprocdisplay stuff.

Remove Raid config define.

Don't play heal song to avoid interrupting map music.

If we need space:
  - Room for 0x2000 text entries. Can reduce this in repointedTextTable.event.
  - Some tables have entries they're not using, see Tables/TableOptions.s.


PLAN, Crafting should allow:
  - fusing two of the same items (total durability no higher than 63?), no material cost. (seems Tequila has a "Convoy Combine" patch which already does this)
  - repairing an item, costs up to 5 different types of materials. Reserve three dec digits for each material (10 bits)
  - upgrading an item. Same idea for costs as above.
